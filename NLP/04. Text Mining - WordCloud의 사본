works fine. 4 stars only because BLU doesn\\'t have a update out yet for android 5.0 to 5.1 or to 6.0 Product was as described. Very pleased with purchase. I waited a little while before posted a review to see if there were any mechanical issues which there hasn\\'t been thus far. Thank you very much Great phone for my needs. The only issue is; it doesn\\'t take clear pics and it takes like 4 hrs to charge other than that it\\'s a pretty good phone This phone is awesome for the price!!! I love motorola gestures and the fingerprint scanner works well. Battery lasts the full day with heavy use, probably two days with minimal use. IMMEDIATELY WORKED WITH VERIZON SIM. No setup necessary. The extra ram is good. It runs pokemon go quite well but I doubt that will remain relevant at this rate. I am very pleased with this purchase. I went cheap and did not get burned. I got much more than I expected. get what u pay for I love this phone but the battery is terrible. Unplug it in the morning and not even an hour later it\\'s down to 90% without even touching it. the battery dies by 3-4pm with minimal usage. Other than that the phone is great Product I returned it , it was locked because it was reported stolen. Sprint the informed me the device will not work because it\\'s looked because it\\'s stolen item. This phone shut down and ask for a lock code. Phone was only one month old. Contacted vendor several times - Nothing they sent work. Its horrible, cause the phone was purchased for someone overseas. In order to bring it back and return would be costly. Really awesome cell phone for right price Brand new in book a s advertised Everyrhing alright I bought this and after I started using it, it will completely shut off around 45%. So I\\'m not very happy with it because my iPhone 5 did the same thing hence why I bought the 6s I love it (: it is the best phone ever nice and small Excellent little phone. For the amazing low price I ordered three and will be ordering more since Family and friends I gifted them to ,loved it.Execellent back up phone and even daily use phone if you dont need a fancy Smartphone Been HTC user for years now and this product is best HTC I had. Awesome screen, wonderful and warm colors with amoled display, what I loved about screen is it doesn\\'t fade in sunlight..!!! Rear cam though is 13 Pix but still lacks the punch, though which pro mode you can create amazing pics. Front cam is best in any phone in this range or of higher range.And yes I opened the box got to phone out booted it, in few minutes alert for Android 6.0.1 update and bammm got Android upgrade within first few minutes of unboxing phone. Now who can give you that amazing service LOVE IT HTC..!!!Yes the speakers a little disappointing but then hey its a new thing they are trying. Let\\'s talk about earphone with Boomsound and Dolby enhance..with in box ear set you get crisp sound and wonderful bass, get a better earphone and DAMNNNNN it\\'s again one the best sound in any phone on this range, it just phenomenal..!!As for HTC sense yes it\\'s as smooth as always and the phone is fast and reaction for apps to open is swift.So yes with price you pay, you get a phone which more worth than what you pay for. Stop listening to people complaining about it looks like IPhone, this HTC device here is better than some brands flagship devices.HENCE THINK TO FURTHER IF YOU FEEL LIKE HAVING IT CLICK THAT ADD TO CART BUTTON..!!! you wont regret 5 stars is not enough for a phone like this. I have had Samsung changing to Samsung was a huge leap. After some years of using smartphones, I love Android and hate Samsung. I think this is a great phone and I am glad I bought it. There are however a few things to keep in mind; these phones are refurbished, not new. And when they say: \"is certified to be 100% functional, and ready for activation\" what they mean is, as long as you already have a 4G sim card for it. I didn\\'t so I waited a few days to receive the sim card Verizon sent me for free. I come from many years of iphone and wanted a mobile larger size than my last iphone iphone 5. I find the price of 6 plus totally crazy and I found in interet good references of this LG G3. First of all, I am delighted with Android, that I find much more logical, intuitive and manageable than IOS (not to mention the nightmare of itunes ....) and this LG G3 has exceeded my best expectations. I am very, very happy with my choice. Delivery was on time. I recommend it. ok Great phone for a good price, i was surprise when i reviced the phone its big and it works greats. love it, love it Fantastic and I love it to the fullest...... I hope it will not crash or give me trouble in the near future? ok I bought a iphone 4s for verizon,off mbc mobile,it didn\\'t really say if it was new or used,but It came,very quickly,brand new in the box! Everything included. I was worried because of some of the reviews,because I was just using it for tracfone,and so far everything is great! Thanks! Definitely recommend! Everything OK. Battery does not last. Constantly shuts off. I wouldn\\'t buy another one. THE SAMSUNG RUGBY 2 OFFERED BY WIRELESS SOLUTIONS ARRIVED IN 1 OR 2 DAYS, AHEAD OF SCHEDULE.

Buenas noches, me comunico con usted porque el telefono me llego, pero me pide un codigo de liberacion como es posible que yo compre algo que diga que esta liberado y cuando llega a venezuela se presenta este problema, por favor necesito soluciones Love this phone. Works great. excelente producto........... Worse phone....EVER!!!!!!!! So far so good, I was sent the xt1635-02, which is a dual Sim Brazilian version. Runs smoothly and the battery is amazing. Very nice phone. Had some problems when it arrived. Everything was in spanish. Once got language straightened out. and got the correct size simm card, Works great. Love it. it is ok for what I needed it for. I needed something where I could quickly and easily set an alarm several time a day. this does the trick. I is a little bully for my taste but I can live with that. I have a fire phone and it does not recognize the software but since I did not get it for its smart watch function I am no to broke up about that. Eventually I will get around to pairing it to one of my old iphones so I can play with it. So far so good! Easy to operate. Clear voice. High quality picture and great speed. All meet my need. Why to spend 300 to 400 dollars for a piece of phone. When my friends heard the price and the size of phone, all feel my phone worth more than I paid. Thanks for the device improve my life the output ratio - price are very good . It is much more than I expected cell phone. Amazing piece of hardware couldn\\'t be happier The phone is just what I wanted Buen celular Works great. Love this phone it\\'s worth the money Bought 2 to take to Greece. Went to Greece, bought two sims so we can call each other here. 200 mins and text time for 15 euros a sim. Guy at the shop installed the sims and setup no problem. Older model but works fine. Very good phone for it price I received my phone today it the phone was in very good condition !!! Love it!!! For the price of the phone was great and they through a car charger in i didnt even no about!!! blue dot is really good!!! Thank you guys!!!! Great phone, ultra fast and pure android experience.Instant 5.1 upgrade The phone is way to slow for smartphone. It is sooooooooooo lag that i have to restart my phone everyday. Not recommend for those who like to play game or surf web. It is super slow to carry out those functions. Love this purchase just as much as the last one. Very satisfied with the 4s - I use it on TING and my bill is 55 a month for two of us who use plenty of data, texts and minutes.Easy to setup on ting. Not unlocked, took it to AT&T today to switch my sim card from my 5s to the new 6s Plus....no go! Super bummed out! So now I\\'ve gotta take it to the Apple Store, which is in the mall...I hate going to the mall...and hope that they can unlock the phone. I pray that they don\\'t tell me it\\'s a fake, like some of the other reviews I\\'ve read. This is a pain in the butt, will probably just end up returning the phone, thats how much I hate going to the mall. Boo to false advertising! i loved it more than I expected it works very well here in Venezuela with Movistar excellent product Can\\'t beat the value ... I was at an Apple store to buy an unlocked iPhone - the cheapest available (an outdated 4S) still would set you back $650+. Yeah, right!It isn\\'t an iPhone, but well built, fast, has dual SIMs, and comes with case and screen protector and absolute cool colors. BTW, Windows 8.1 works well and is stable & supports many foreign languages and keyboards. It also comes with Windows Office apps (PowerPoint, Word, Excel) ... not all apps are quite yet on Windows, but that\\'s a small compromise considering the overall value you are getting. Very good and reliable smart phone. I\\'ve had my G3 for about a month and to be quite honest I consider this to be the best phone I\\'ve ever had. However that all changed this morning. The phone died overnight and when I woke up I put it to get a quick charge up ( Using the official LG cable mind you) before I left for work. I got no response at all from the phone. The usual red LED light indicating charging was not there, nor the usual screen with the battery charging that pops up when you put a switched off phone to charge. I\\'ve checked troubleshooting forums and gone through the usual hoopla and taken out the battery multiple times and such like, and still this has me frustrated. This was supposed to be a NEW PHONE...how can it have these serious issues only 1 month in.UPDATE...I would not recommend this seller to anyone. After quite some time of going around to independent phone repair organizations to no avail ( because the seller would not help me anyway) I finally returned the phone to LG UK. Only to find out that I had been duped. While the phone had a pristine and wonderful looking exterior it was nothing more than a sham. The internals of the phone were nothing more than cheap knockoff chinese parts. So I was sold a crap phone by a dishonest company... This is infuriating!!! DO NOT BUY THIS PHONE!!! DO NOT BUY FROM THIS SELLER!!! Have had nothing but problems with this phone. Won\\'t charge so have to switch battery to another phone to charge. I LOVE this model , but this phone is NOT good! Love it This phone is great for gamers, I love it. This phone is at Costa Rica and works with ICE SIMCARDEste teléfono es genial, me encanta. Este teléfono está en Costa Rica y funciona con el SIM del ICE Too difficult to put in the battery. Had to return it. Meh its a 35.00 smartwatch it does what it says little cheap but it works as described I don\\'t like installing a non verified apk for my phone needs to be compatible with Google wear from play store It said it was a 4g phone.... it\\'s not.... It\\'s so quiet you can\\'t hardly hear it when it rings or get a text. I just thought that polaroid would put out a better product. I feel that it was a waste of money! WHAT A PITY! I think this phone is perfect in every perspective except it got two major flaws making it impossible.Heat control and battery life.It gets really hot if you run any app for 1 min or 2 and it won\\'t cool down for a long time and I didn\\'t run any big 3d games.Battery life is ridiculously short.I left home 10am with a full charge,WIFI on 4g or 3g network OFF,took about 20 pictures,listened music for like 2 hours,nothing else.It unbelievably ran out at 3PM!!!!!!And I don\\'t know if it\\'s common,receiver is not working good,I have to plug in earphone everytime I call somebody.Returned it already. this phone is great...sleek design,nice keys,customizable display,cool ringtones...the only downfall is mms settings,can\\'t make it to work with t-mobile but internet works great and bluetooth as well...cool phone The phone came with NOTHING ..... It was fully charged though which gave me enough time too get a charger and headphones The phone had issues.first of all the upper part of the screen is discolored. When using earphones and charging or when using phone as a car ipod, the phone begins to make a loud deafening sound . The phone camera freezes too. All these continue until there\\'s a restart of the phone. Which means you have to wait longer SO far, so good, delivery was on time. Product was as offered I love this phone looks & works like new The screen shattered in the first week, I have never had a cellphone break this easily. It did not have any tv function. Could not get 4g speed Excellent Most of the retailers on this site are selling used phones advertised as new. I personally have done business with one retailer, Cellphones-4u. The phone arrived in a Verizon box, unsealed, loosely floating in a plastic tray, not an LG box as it should have been. You could tell the wall charger was extremely used and subsequently, didn\\'t work. Immediate RED flag. Called Verizon, gave them the MEID# that is located inside the battery compartment. The lady told me that the phone had been used on the separate accounts. So it spent most of it\\'s life in shipment. Cellphones-4u keeps insisting that it is new from Verizon. He posted it under my bad review on their site. So, he is calling me and Verizon liars. In hindsight, I noticed that every bad review that was posted for Cellphones-4u, he had a reply that they were in essence, thieves or liars. Do your homework. When you receive your phone, call your service provider, give them the MEID# and find out if it is indeed a new phone. They are charging new price, make them provide what they advertise. I purchased the Blu Studio C Mini, 4.7 last month and have enjoyed it without any issues. I am using it with my Net10,no contract,unlimited plan and I\\'m very pleased with it\\'s look, feel and performance. I upgraded from an older model Samsung smartphone and cannot understand what all the negative reviews are about. If you have been using or are using a high-end 400-600 dollar phone then that is what you should be comparing it to; not a 120 dollar phone. Although, I will say that this 120.00 dollar Blu smartphone far exceeded my expectations. The picture is clear and crisp and the quality is better than my old phone. The only minor complaint that I have about the phone is the speaker quality. The speaker does have a bit too much treble to it\\'s tone, but I was able to make equalizer adjustments through the \"Play Music\" player. I\\'ve enjoyed watching Netflix movies with no lag time whatsoever. The only time I\\'ve noticed any lag was while watching some Youtube videos, but I experienced the same lag on my laptop. Before I even turned it on, I installed a 32gb mini SD card and have more than enough memory for the few apps and games that I prefer. My wife and I liked the phone so much that she also upgraded to the same phone in the orange color (nice and bright). Like I said, it\\'s no high-end phone, but its an excellent buy for under 120.00 dollars. I highly recommend this phone. Thanks Amazon. Perfect,except you need sd card from day one .the internal memory is low. Excelente the screen gone black I will NEVER order anything from Focus Electronics & Appliances again. I received the item within a promise delivery time-frame, which is great. So I use the phone for about a week. Everytime I make or receive call, the people on the other end told me that the conversation is breaking up and they CANNOT hear me. I had to switch my old Blackberry. I called Focus Electronics & Appliances, I stated the problem and the rep said it was my provider. I told her I have no reception problem with my Blackberry. I told her I switch phone because couple keys on the Blackberry is kind a stuck every now and then. She told me the Blackberry is a better phone than the Razor and I can return the item if I\\'m not happy with it. Again, I told her it is not that I\\'m not happy, but the reception is terrible. So I return the phone and Focus Electronics & Appliances only partially refunded me. They charged 20% for re-stocking fee and kept the S/H for a DEFECTIVE item that they sent to me. I filed a claim with Amazon. Amazon immediately refunded the difference that the merchant didn\\'t. Amazone is a great company and I\\'ll continue to shop with Amazon. But I will NOT buy anything from Focus Electronics & Appliances. Great product. This is my second blu phone and the only reason for update I ran out of memory space on old phone. I am still getting used to this phone but seems to be a good product for me. I use it for personal and business with a second phone app. I agree with some reviews the ring volume is not great but is workable. The screen and size are great speed seems good also not a lot of bloatware on phone. Setup was pretty easy with google transfer of apps and contacts pretty pain free. All in all for price good phone. Great phone! Junk I\\'m hoping this time it will last,it is my 2nd time purchasing lumia,the ist time opnly lasted 3 mos. Its the Best phone I have used till now. Large screen size, feasible to do a lot of stuff online without using a tablet. As soon i powered it on, it came up with Jelly Bean update. Touch is good & very sensitive. But it does have some cons too check them out.Pros:1. Latest Andriod, instant update to Jelly Bean.2. Large screen, good enough for browsing, watching vidoes, playing games.Cons :1. Hardware is weak. Couple of the apps get terminated abruptly.2. Cam is not good enough.3. Battery. A full charge doesnt get me a day.4. Low sound in Speaker phone mode. Pretty great phone. It had some flaws but it worked great overall so nice excelent phone Great condition! Great phone. good phone and economy Bought this as a gift for my hubby. He loves it and never goes anywhere without it. It works fine with his network (outside of the US) and it\\'s been quite reliable and useful in keeping us connected between countries. It\\'s a beautiful phone with so many awesome capabilities and the price was great. Great I had had this before but lost it, now I bought this international version hoping for it to work in central america and It did marvelously right out the box. Double SIM capability and a faster processing due to the lack of the typical stuff phone companies pre install to their own phones. I\\'m in love with my BIG Samsung Galaxy Grand 2 all over again. oh and if you want to install Kit Kat it works really good. Bad quality product Great phone at good price!! would not honor their warranty. A lot of people that I encouraged to purchase the phone had similar issues with the charging element in the phone. So far so good . I like this cell phone. I love it - larger words with extra apps. I don\\'t use all of them but just few to keep me doing what I needed. This is a cool item. Finds BlueTooth devices easily. There are some features which I have not figured out how to use yet, but hope learn through a dedicated forum if I can find one I specifically want to be able to control iPOD camera from watch such as when iPOD mounted to bicycle handle bars. according to expectations, very good article Nice big screen. Works 100% as advertised. 5 stars Not what I had expected. Has hole in the back for the Apple symbol. I was expecting higher grade with a complete full wrap around. It\\'s ok,but doesn\\'t have instructions I like this phone. I purchased it as an upgrade to my Lumia 635 after the last firmware update was unable to smoothly run on it. Everything that was good about the 635 is good about the 435. The orange plastic came broken unable to use it This is a very functional small iPhone; easy to carry, microphone and speakers provide adequate volume. I like the Jitterbug. I like that it has a dial tone when it\\'s turned on and the sound quality is excellent. It is very easy to use. The only complaint is that the minutes don\\'t roll over month to month. If you don\\'t use them they expire. After going through 5 phones for my mother who constantly got frustrated because they were too difficult to deal with I found her this gem! It has a great camera, she can see the numbers, she loves that she can see the pictures on the full screen and can text with ease. I highly recommend this phone for the not so saavy tech people. I\\'ve had this phone a while now and In still so glad I bought this. The quality is so Impressive And for so much less than the. Samsung It replaced. Loved it so much I bought my daughter one, she raves about it and has had many of her friends inquire about hers. I\\'m sure these phones will sell themselves when. People realize the value. Thanks Data does not work after hours of talking with ATT on phone for APN settingsClock resets when changing sim.Very quite cant hear even when on loud with headphones or notno smart sync bluetooth --- cant pair to headphones A good phone and very useful. Programmable to a new number. Met my expectations entirely and completely. Would recommend it Phone is too fragile looking- size is too small. Tendency to drop it but it\\'s a nice looking phone. Instructions are in diff language & not in English. Will be returning the phone. I purchased this item as an anniversary present for my husband and he is so in love with it. Although he is not \"smart phone\" inclined he is really enjoying learning all the features. I am truly pleased. As for the product it works well, no complaints in that department. Great inexpensive phone! This was delivered way sooner than expected! And works perfectly! the phone froze on blu logo and there has not come not even two months hard as I can haver ahhh This phone sucks! Even bought a new 32GB SD card, and it wouldn\\'t download any apps! No GPS, I got a new phone with-in a week of buying this phone. Never again will I buy a cell phone off amazon, or the brand BLU !!! Delivers what it promises. Buyer Venezuela As espected, 100% recommed. Aceptable Execelente equipo. todo llego en buen estado. funciona aqui en venezuela con las tres operadoras. compacto, resistente y manejable.Otro gran telefono de Nokia. Never go with this product. Was working fine for a couple of months and stopped working. Excellent phone! Battery has given me 4 days of continuous use without charging and with all features enabled.Functional,attractive-----well worth the price.Highly recommended! To be honest, this iphone 6s plus 128G looks like a new one. For the price it\\'s a good buy. works 85% of time. other times cant make a call or even text. contacted company they wante me to upgrade. sounds suspious to me. send me phone that doesnt work and then want me to spend more money to upgrade. beware My son loves this phone! Research in Motion got it right this time, moving from a Storm 2, i think this is the real deal and at that price -yes maybe even a better deal. I like the sensitivity of the touch not even the iphone has that.HIghly reccomendable Great product, as we\\'ve come to expect from Otterbox. this is my firts blackberry and i love it soo much the color is great it fit perfect in your hands Love my phone! Fast shipping! Thanks! Excellent it was a little late they said something and the package was here not the date they said so! This little thing has almost everything the SIII has and works just as well. Samsung has made very good products and this is not the exemption. Would recommend to anyone. It\\'s soo nice I love it Bought this to use when traveling internationally .. Works well and is a great travel phone .. Pop in a local sim and your good to go The simpler the better. No problem at all with this phone. excellent I did not receive my headphone jack When I received this phone, I took it to my cell phone provider to have a SIM card put in it. The SIM card would not work because the phone had been reported as STOLEN. Awesome Had to send the first phone back. And now the second phone freezes and force closes. It work very good. Thank you. I love Lumia 920 <3 I am impressed with the quality of this phone,The Xperia Z5 display excellent color reproduction and sharpness, has an excellent image, the glass screen feels sturdy, the software and hardware environment respond quickly and smooth, I have been using continuously and has no overheating by the continued use of streaming as z3,The Xperia Z5 is very well put together, with Gorilla Glass 4 on the front and back, an aluminum frame and rubber bumpers on the corners to help absorb shock if the phone is dropped,The camera has truly excellent auto-focus,regarding the battery of sony phone I do not see a big difference compared to other phones like Samsung or IPhone S6,but The biggest departure in design terms, is the look of the power button. Sony’s trademark protruding chrome-effect circle, which has been around for years, has now been replaced by an elongated lozenge, slightly inset from the edge to prevent you accidentally pressing it.I particularly recommend this phone to a friend. EXCELENTE Was. Exactly what I was looking for . exelente Great product, good delivery time line. like radio but did not work with Iwirless This case is very efficient. Not to mention, I like the pretty colors. I LOST IT. Item received in the expected conditions. Love my new phone Actually no I am very unsatisfied with this because for it being a certified like-new product the charge port does not work properly I have only been able to use the standard slow charging charger because the fast charger does not work unless you apply slight pressure on the charger plug going into the phone up word which is not cool to me because it can damage the phone I plan on sending it back in to have it replaced for a better operational phone 25 Days later and about a week of actual use/activation the phone completely dies when inserting an sd card. it detected it than immediately powered down, i\\'ll change the review if i can get it to power on but for now this phone appears to be rather poorly made. can\\'t set phone to buss and let you know there is a call and then speak on phone you have to talk on watch other parts work fine I\\'ve had several issues with non contract phones (I have to replace my droid as my cell plan isn\\'t eligible for an upgrade yet) and I didn\\'t have a lot of hope in finding something under $200. This phone is small, light weight and has great screen quality. It was easy to activate, configure, and nothing hangs or force closes. One thing to note...the screen is smaller than most smart phones. A lot of landscape is occupied with numerous buttons and frames but they don\\'t detract from the general usefulness. Overall, this is a quality, affordable phone. Recommend! Not bad for the cost. Works fine but the speaker is not to clear. is is not unlocked Great for the price; second one I\\'ve purchased for a son who needs only basic functions. phone is simple to use, audio is very clear. the only drawback is battery life. it has to be charged every day. Too small phone I ordered the iPhone 6s plus, but get the iPhone 6s. love my phone. This phone has everything I need. It has a powerful 16 MP camera that any phone could envy; I almost think sometimes that it will take X-rays instead of pictures, because of the balancing provided by its sensors. The Quantum Display shows its very fine quality on every picture or video. The phone practically functions with all the service providers worldwide. My problems with installing APK\\'s have finished thanks to its big 32 GB (The LGGUS991-32GB). I only would like that in this spectacular phone, the FM radio works, but isn\\'t the fact. I\\'m still delighted with it. When the perfect phone appears, I will hate mine, but until then I still love it!!! I bought this phone used and it has just been great.ma texas Has worked perfectly since I bought it (about a year and a half?) and still does. A very good company to buy from. this is not new used scrtch ,bad box excellent Love the phone nice Although the phone arrived locked, the seller replied to my message within one day with the unlock code. The phone is otherwise perfect and exactly as described, 4G works without a hitch in Australia.Amazing build quality as always from Nokia/Microsoft, price and the chipset aside it truly feels like a premium flagship but luckily the Windows OS is very light and speedy so it doesn\\'t need the overbearing CPU power and RAM that android devices need to run smoothly. The camera is an absolute joy in good and bad light. Color reproduction is spot on and very vibrant. Zero complaint about the phone, I could care less about the congested app store on android and iOS. I just want a simplistic, solid, premium phone and this is just that.The seller was BREED, very well mannered and despite needing one more day to get the phone unlocked, I really appreciate how quickly resolved the issue for me. I would buy from them again for sure but in the future I think it would be better if you guys just shipped the unlock code! Excelente!!! Got phone on time and worked perfectly. excellent phone! excellent great iphone for a very good price Great price, middling phone. awsome phone till crackhead stole it I did not like this product. After putting the case on my phone I could not hear and the people I called could not hear me. What is the purpose of the phone if I can\\'t the person on the other end. I get that the box was designed to keep weather out but damn if you can\\'t us the phone what good is the product. Excellent very good I had this phone for like 3 weeks now. Couldn\\'t get it to connect to metropcs, went in the office the guy there said that I will have problems with it. Anyhow I bought the sim card online from metropcs, call the customer service and get it to connect. Since using it is a descent phone got no problem with my carrier like what the guy said in the store.. My only prob was the APN settings.. Great phone for the price. Loving what I am getting from it.. Would recommend it... Nothing to regret love it sooooooooo much\\' I refuse to pay the high prices for other well known phones. I love this phone. No problems so far. Mine is a pretty orange, and is definitely me. Has been fun learning all the neat features. got this phone and i am completely happy.Works just as described.Having no problems whatsoever and am able to blaze thru the web on it and download and do whatever i choose.very nice it\\'s perfect Everything as expected, the description readed in reviews and on Samsung webpage, are pretty acurrate. excelente the phone looks brand new, works just like a brand new phone. it came super early and i was very satisfied! thank you! The product does not hold a charge as well as other units I have purchased. Excelent A lot of storage is used up on software when purchased. Some glitches with suddenly turning on and off. Overall functional. Much better than windows phone, but I have no doubt that my next phone will be better Battery doesn\\'t last more than 2 hours, it goes from 50% to 10% in a minute otter case = checkblack = checka+ Fantastic Works well. Great price. Unlocked and dual sim. i bought two phones the same exact ones , and so far I\\'m in love w. it ! it came perfect in good condition camera works great everything works great Excelente telefono i like it I love this phone I like almost everything about this phone - it looks nice, has a useful physical keyboard, easy to use / figure out, and has good call quality.Something about the size or weight of the phone makes it a bit awkward for me to hold at times, and thus I\\'ve dropped it more than any other phone I\\'ve had to-date. I had a BB Bold before this which was heavier, had narrower sides, but was fatter in depth and it felt great in my hands and was rarely dropped.Also, after a few months of use, the \"t\" became very sensitive causing multiple \"t\"s to generate with normal pressure. Apparently, this is an issue many BB 10 users have. So far I\\'m not bothered enough by it to do something about it.Finally, I\\'ve come across two folks who looked at this phone as if they\\'d discovered dinosaur bones in their backyard. They couldn\\'t believe people \"still used blackberries with keyboards\" although both admitted it is a smart looking phone. I received this today (Yay for Prime!) and I was frustrated at first. This is a standalone smart watch, not meant to be a companion to a smart phone. I couldn\\'t get my SIM card to register with the watch. The slot for the SIM card is huge, at least it\\'s huge for my microSD SIM card. The manual is in Chinese and English. It\\'s a tiny manual and the illustrations are even tinier. I inserted my SIM card the way it showed in the illustration, and it didn\\'t work. I finally was able to maneuver it into a position that allows it to work. I\\'m still learning how to work the watch, but it is handy if you need your phone but don\\'t want to carry a bulky one. One thing I would suggest is ordering a larger SDHC memory card. The 4gb memory card that is included is not enough by far. Also, the camera is positioned in a way where the only good part is that you can be sneaky with it. For those that like to take selfies and us-ies, the camera on this watch won\\'t help you. Overall, it\\'s a good smart watch so far. Good! Hate it. Hate it.Hate it. I didn\\'t realize how annoying the lockscreen ads would be. I\\'ll be trading it in for a phone without the ads as soon as I can. Yuck! nice and small The lcd dead don\\'t buy this phone, you can use it 1 month, after 1 month it turn off Blackberry 9105V5.0.0.629 (GPRS, WiFi)Not working:GPSPiNNot Refreshing or Updating:Host Routing TableNot Able to Download:App World the best camera in a mobile phone Good product, fast. Nothing to complain Difficult to navigate, touch screen is very \"touchy\" - difficult to get to respond easily. Worst of all after just over 6 months of little use the battery won\\'t charge correctly. Every time we try to charge it it states to make sure we have the correct charger connected even though we are using the one that came with the phone. This is a poorly designed phone from top to bottom. After 6 months of trying to adapt we have given up and are buying another phone. that\\'s ok, a good piece, grand seller This has been a good phone for the money. The camera isn\\'t very good to be a 13 meg pixel because it just doesn\\'t take that good a picture. the phone has locked up constantly since we received it. It has not worked properly. These work almost exactly as described - the app to make the watch fully functional with a HTC One will not download after scanning the QR code. With that being said - through the bluetooth connection you can make & receive calls, play music (although the speaker is on the quiet side) and take pics & send them to the phone via bluetooth. These were gifts for preteen boys and they could not be happier with them. They do really everything they wanted and I would consider them a great starter smart watch especially the small price tag. Also the band is very sturdy and secure - which was an important feature to me. It\\'s beautiful, easy to use and so fast!. Microsoft do the best work with the OS and Nokia with the phone. Only two issues: First: At the time i received it in my country (Venezuela), four months later (thanks LibertyExpress), I need to Update the phone 5 times (3 updates for Windows Phone, two for Nokia - Lumia Amber and Black) to get the best experience. That was so easy. And second: It has the AT&T logo, but it\\'s okay, it\\'s unlocked.Finally, I have a Smartphone that covers all my mobile needs. I have a powerful camera (Perhaps no more powerful than the Lumia 1020) and now I have a very good reason to celebrate, since I came back to buy one of the Nokia\\'s best masterpieces. Awesome phone. Great quality, good graphics and looks. I will say it\\'s quality outstand the price you will pay. This is great! I love it! the phone arrived as expected, so far is working just fine. i love Xperia style and this phone looks and feels great Very poor quality, it doesn\\'t work or function when the mini SD card is inserted, I still can use it for time keeping otherwise I would rather have not buying it Good phone I LOVE MY NEW PHONE! SO GLAD I READ THE REVIRWS SND DEVIFEF ON THIS ONE VS THE SAMSUNG GALAXY S5.DhhONT GET ME WRONG, I LOVED MY SAMSUNG GALAXY BUT THIS PHONE IS THE BEST!!!!!! ALL THE FUNCTIONS IF THE SASUMG BUT I HAVE $400 EXTRA IN MY POCKET NOW beautiful and working good IT IS A EXCELLENT PHONE I like it becouse the price is razonable I bought this phone because i didnt want to pay the price of an iphone.Now, after a few months of use, the phone is goung crazy...it keeps shutting down when i whatching any video or trying to take a picture or even playing a game like candy crush or smth... It doenst matter how full the battery is...sometimes i have over 90% and it still shuts down. For two times now it also happened that it restarts NON STOP. And nothing i can do to stops it from restarting. It keeps restarting untill the battery dies. Fast delivery and works good. I LOVE THS PHONE...I got it because i had a Samsung galaxy S6 with 32G and no removable battery....and I hate that...so I swich to LG....and got the awesome LG V10....I\\'m very impressed. And that\\'s coming from a guy that is a Samsung lover....I had a an S3, S4, S5, S6....and I waited for the S7...and it finally came out and we\\'ll it let me very desapointed..not much different that my s6....so that\\'s why I have a V10..love the 5.7 inch screen...great resolution....and something that I love in the Samsung and don\\'t have it any more....it\\'s the removable battery and the option of adding more memory....I ran out of memory on my s6...and we\\'ll had to let go of Samsung for good...now LG will be my number one phone for me...the LG v10 is a big phone not for everyone....for someone with big had like me will enjoy this phone a lot... Little brother\\'s first phone.The price point is perfect for the performance it provides, and adds some peace of mind. It\\'s not an expensive phone, so it\\'s not like he\\'s playing around with $600-700. The android experience on it is pretty clean overall, and I can tell he\\'s pretty comfortable with it. I love this phone. Personally, I like my mobile phones to be mobile. I don\\'t want to look like I\\'m talking to a graphing calculator. It\\'s fast, has a great camera, and fits in all my pockets. It\\'s an older model and very affordable. So I didn\\'t expect much as for computing performace. It\\'s a bit slow but the better more efficient apps like Google or gmail or mymail works great.For phone calls you have to place the tip of the phone on your ear, which I didn\\'t know at first and couldn\\'t hear very well. But once I figured it out I heard fine.I bought it as a travel phone, and got it for the battery life. Battery life is very good. I have used anything that lasted this long so it\\'s hard to compare, but this phone should be my benchmark for long lasting phones from now on.It lasts me about 2 days. I use mostly mymail, google, yelp, facebook, google maps for driving navigation, and expedia as apps. All in all, it\\'s a great travel phone for the money. excelente It\\'s not a real LG G3. After a quick examination with a real G3 we notice that it was a knock-off. It does not work very well. I bought his phone for an upgrade after I got tired of my iPhone 5. They are in great condition Good phone, slipped the ATT sim card and off it went! No complaints, great reception for voice calls, typing is easy,text messaging a breeze. Smart phone nope! Great call quality and competent texting phone, definitely! Do the math, and take into account the ATT $36.00 activation when you get that \"free\" upgrade, which includes a new 2 year contract at the higher subsidized monthly rate, before you have to sharpen your pencil you will realize this phone paid for itself in under 3 months! Don\\'t hesitate to recommend it highly if this is what you are in the market for. excelente I too received an opened phone in a package that had an opened seal which stated: Do not accept if seal is broken.IN talking to Amazon customer service, they fairly easily facilitatd a return...BUT that is a huge pain in the neck, having to now wait to get another phone.In speaking to BLUTEKUSA, I was told that this has been a continual problem with AMazon. BLUTEKUSA feels that AMazon is sending out returned, used phones as new. BLUTEKUSA claims that they have tried to remedy the problem with AMazon, but have had not response and actually have difficulty contacting AMazon.If the above is true, I would say: AMAZON, CLEAN UP YOUR ACT. Samsung has lived up to there standard giving great service. Perfect Even though this is a simple slider phone, it is exactly what my wife wanted and she loves it. Would buy again. Amazing phone the best smartphone ever Was well loved, but developed issues over time. The screen started to show some discoloration with the pixels, couldn\\'t connect to bluetooth and had trouble with the battery staying charged. other than those issues, phone worked well. Excellent cel, really nice photos. Like the new design. Phone is ok but Touch is not working properly My brother was happy... got it for him for christmas.. better than any other phone he has gotten.. very satisfied! Thank you!!! very very good in less than a year no power due to software problems .irrecoverable Im blown away at how amazing a phone thats this old is! I came from an iphone 4 that i got at the beginning of the year and im never going back! This is my first htc phone and i freacking love it! Its fast, the screen is amazing quality, and it truly is incredible! This is a great little phone. One big star off for non-instructive directions. They say what you can do, but not how to do it. I nearly broke the darn thing trying to lift the SIM card slot the same way the memory card slot lifts to load. I may have broken the 2nd SIM card slot, but I don\\'t know how to check. I wonder if I can just put SIM card 1 in the # 2 slot to test? I think now that you aren\\'t supposed to lift the SIM card slot, just slide it under the bar. Instructions would have helped. Other than that, it is a great, simple little phone, especially for older folks that don\\'t want or need a smartphone. And the battery is amazing. I haven\\'t used it much, but the stand-by battery is awesome. I charged it once when I got a couple of weeks ago and the charge is still full. Great phone for a little peace of mind. Great Product For the price it\\'s a decent phone. The dual sim capability is cool it\\'s like having two phones in one. It is unlocked but pending where your location is will tell how the phone acts on the carrier. The not so good is the camera. Out of focus and dull. Not the best. Also it restarts out of the blue for some reason but for the price and what\\'s all included it\\'s not a bad phone. If you\\'ve got the patience for Windows 8 then go for it. Patience is a virtue with this phone sometimes the battery madden but in general it s a great cell phone I bought this to replace my husband\\'s blackberry storm he lost in the airport. He is so please with it\\'s sleek design. He likes it a lot. So easy to use and surf the web too. A perfect little thing specially for a busy, always-on-the-go and not gadget freak person like him. This phone was an upgrade from the first Galaxy and is much better. The activation process was easy and well documented. I am very satisfied with this upgrade. I didn\\'t want to have to spend a ton of money and didn\\'t need a lot of features. For the price this so far has been an excellent choice. I purchased this for my son to use and it was a great buy for the price. The charger didnt work, I suppose that it meant to work on China, and the language is on Chinese too, not so hard to change to english though, the cellphone excelent! The main touch button give hard time to switch page/screen.When I read the review about this I PHONE• Apple iPhone 4S 32GB White - Unlocked by Apple• Used, Very Good• In Stock• Shipped from: MobileSpree• Gift options not available. Learn more Excellent! !!! great product considering the price vs quality It was a stolen phone very dissatisfied I didn\\'t like the idea that the watch is having a camera EDIT: I\\'ve had some problems with the screen becoming disconnected from the rest of the phone which makes it turn off randomly at some times. I\\'ve had to take it to get it fixed, which cost about $65 and I\\'m disappointed because besides that it has been working fine. I\\'m having the same problem again now, possibly due to me dropping it (whoops) but I wish there was a way I could get it fixed for free through a warranty.--------------------The unlocked Galaxy S5 works like new! I\\'m able to use Tracfone with it which saves me a lot of money. So far I haven\\'t had any problems with it, although the only small complaint that I have is that the charger port cover does not snap in properly, but it can still stay closed so it\\'s not really a problem. Overall I\\'d definitely recommend this!! An excellent simple slider phone for someone who just wants to call and text. Has large enough numbers to read and use. Has capability of having an outdoor ring that is very loud. I love this phone. My last three phones have been this phone. The last two phones played out because they got water damage. I bought this phone for my sister n law and she loves it. Nice phone for the price! Amazing The phone is for my brother, it is very beautibul, but is big even for him, but it is a good phone for the price worth it. I am absolutely inlove with this phone. The battery life is more than 24hrs after using it constantly, it does not overheat, both cameras are perfecttttt.. I am inlove with the front flash. Honestly I\\'ve had a lot of samsung phones and this is a perfect choice.. I love it.. It\\'s amazing.. Battery runs out instantly once it reaches 40% - 30%. Time is reset once battery drains to 0%. The camera is of horrible quality - does not focus well and does poorly in low light conditions. Otherwise OK so far. Great cell phone. Well built. I like the versatility of having both GSM and CDMA in the phone. ITEM IS HANGING OFF AND NOT EVERY TIME THAT HAPPENS; WHAT WAS NOT EXPECTING, BECAUSE I DO NOT LIKE THE SYSTEM DOES NOT OPERATE YOUR PHONE Died after 3 1/2 months. Lost all my pictures. Truly disappointing Excellent! The Blackberry 8520 is a versatile, easy to use and very powerful smartphone.I bought it for my 14 year old daughter, and she is very happy with this phone.Our family members are Blackberry fans, and one of the things we love is the Blackberry messenger which allows us to communicate easily and at no additional cost. muy buen cel me llego en perfecto estado funciona al 100 % con movilnet y le vanta el 3g recomendado 10 puntos Not a good choice at all. Son liked that it was so small but he dropped it once and the screen has black lines thru it. Seems very cheaply made. Even though it\\'s small I still expected decent quality. Product was purchased on Aug 3, 2016 it is now November 9 and the Phone fails to charge. Replaced the battery and no power. I used other phones and each battery work. I was respectfully refunded the amount originally spent on Phone The microphone was not working at all. couldnt use ir before and now I found it out. Never buy something used form amazon!!!!!! it is a scam I still have alot to learn about this phone but so far it is good. Especially when it enables me to access so many of these apps for free in customizing my phone, the picture quality is great. Love my LG G3 D855 Like new! Works great! Fast shipping! Thanks!!! I love it! It is everything I expected it to be! Authentic packaging and all the little details that normally count were there, including a holster. Everything was great, shipment was super express! Very good phone. I highly recommend it for interested buyers Purchased this item and it doesn\\'t recognize my SIM card. Great phone. Comes with all the tools you would ever need and of course there are tons of apps to choose from. Large, sleek, fast and fun. Excellent VERY GOOD THE RECOMMENDED PRODUCT THE PRODUCT AND THE SELLER I don\\'t think this phone was brand new. If it was new then I was one of the unlucky ones to get a bad phone that heats up with very little use and discharges too quick. Not satisfied. I should have considered all he bad reviews and not have gotten a sony Xperia . ok DAUGHTER IS VERY HAPPY AND THAT SAYS IT ALLLL. I asked amazon if I can use this phone in Japan, and I got an answer \"yes\". Unfortunately I could not use this phone in Japan. Too bad.Good size screen, but typing is not easy. Not very sensitive to the touch. Also a little slow. This phone hasn\\'t given me any problems! It\\'s practically brand new! Great buy!! very good product, recommended surely works perfectly, I have no complaints or the product or the seller. brought complete accessories all really very safe It\\'sn a powerfull phone. battery life is a little short I return to what I know and I\\'m comfortable with. Thank you for a quality product. Todo exelente, tal cual como lo describio el vendedor, exelente telefono... nuevo y liberado. 100 % recomendado en la comunidad Great quality nice phone. Super cool case keeps my tablet safe, way easier to grip now. I pulled out the screen protector cause it made the screen look bad and the feel was poor. The cover plate /stand is a cool addition. Very well made Product delivered as promised in a timely manner At this point, I have nothing to complain about. Granted, I\\'ve only had it for a month, but I love everything about it. It\\'s fast, has plenty of memory for me, and it was really well priced. I bought three phones. They are excellent. Thanks to an honest carrier employee, I was pointed to the internet to get a replacement phone for mine that had a disappearing screen. I found the exact same model, in a new phone, for a price much more reasonable than the carrier could have ever provided. The ordering and shipping process was fast and clean. And I am quite satisfied with the purchase, and with the vendor. Excellent Scrath product, es usado no nuevo!! Excelente producto a un buen precio, se recibió de forma rápida y eficiente recomiendo a este vendedor al 100%, el teléfono llegó a mis manos en perfectas condiciones. I was unaware that Verizon isn\\'t GSM compatible, I liked the phone but was unable to use it. How do I return it? very good! Got it as a gift for Father\\'s Day for my dad, it\\'s great! He loves it and wears it everyday. User friendly. It started off ok, but now it locks up. Maybe a drop of water got in the USB port (right side), but the button is now locked out within minutes of starting. Pretty much a writeoff. Muy buen Producto!!!, tal como lo quería, completo y con todo lo que decía la publicidad. me funciono perfecto con mi compañía de telefonía local en Venezuela. The phone is a gift. They arrange that I pay the bill and the user never sees the bill.They worked with me and the the new user is finding the phone very easy to use. The phone worked great for under a year and then the antenna broke and I couldn\\'t get a signal from the cellular network anymore. Niiiiice. It was ok...!!!!! Cheaply made. The power button broke and now I can\\'t turn it on It seems that there are many posable outcomes when buying from this seller, because i checked the reviews before buying and found many more positive than negative but i have to say, this phone did NOT deliver. It was not 4G capable, which apparently is a quality of factory unlocked phones however this was not explained and was a big let down. secondly the battery literally lasted for 23 min, i\\'m not sure why because since it was new one would think that it would function as well as any other blackberry but it would over heat and then die literally in 23 min.lastly and most importantly, it did not ever find a network connection, with T-Mobil or AT&T, it was not branded but the start up screen was some company i had never heard of. all in all, my experience was terrible and all i can hope is that they let me return it for a full refund. I have received my Samsung Galaxy S7 G935F satisfactorily, NGP Store you are the Best! Thank you for the order. I will have present you for make more purchases in the future. Its performance is not the best now but still works very well. Its an amazing phone and i love it this was one of the crappiest phones I\\'ve ever purchased, if I could give no stars that\\'s what it would be.....my phone (which I mean this one) was recently stolen from my job. And I\\'ve yet to contact the seller for a replacement , my response to it being stolen was ha ha, the joke is on them! This phone froze up on me more times then I can count! It have even cut off on it\\'s own , or has taken long to cut back on, the camera is some crap!!!!! And here I was thinking that oh since it was a \"Polaroid\" brand then the camera would or should be great! No.....no, that certainly wasn\\'t the case, the only thing I\\'m mad about with my phone being stolen is that my memory card and sim card is gone to! working well after two months no complaints at all The number button are not working properly This refurbished phone was a piece of junk. Had to use speaker to talk to people and the home button didn\\'t work. Great product I love love love this phone,going to buy another one.you cand bet the price. Good. came apart after 90 days Just only one fall and broke the screen, not recommend! My issue is with specific vendor that sold me mine, not with BlackBerry or Amazon. On receipt of this phone, I find out it is clearly an AT&T branded variant version of the Priv that is not unlocked. Rather, the instructions to unlock it and use with any GSM carrier are included with the phone. Also included are a page full of printed instructions telling you over and over that if you are unable to unlock this phone, per the instructions, then it\\'s basically all on you - no refunds, exchanges, etc. This is not a OEM factory unlocked BlackBerry version. That it is an AT&T variant is unclear in the item description as written, and is not revealed until you open the phone after delivery and see it in the AT&T box with the AT&T logo on the back of the phone. I thought, and everything on the posting indicated, that I was purchasing a BlackBerry factory unlocked, unbranded Priv. Very disappointed... Returned. phone specifications do not correspond to the offered Shipping was very fast. Phone has minor scratches but nothing noticeable. All in all 5 starts!!! Got this phone a few days ago and it was in perfect condition ! I went yesterday and hooked it up to tmobile . This phone is perfect no flaws at all. The seller is awesome as well and even checked in with me after the phone was delievered to make sure I was happy! Thank you so much . Amazing phone. I love how fast it is. I would buy 100 times over. Yes I just purchased this product and I am highly satisfied 5stars I would like it to give me a direct link to address book like my old Nokia. But otherwise it is good. exellent It disconnects with no warning and no reason. The phone can right beside of the watch and it will still disconnect Pro:EVERYTHING (I had a nexus 5 and it was jut pain with signal and quality. My NEXUS 5 BENT)- Aluminum housing- Fast and Furious- Hanged only 1 time so far in 3 months (mutiple calls, fb, whatsapp, etc)- NEXUS 5 killerCons:- Whoever was the camera engineer should be fired. My 5 year old digi cam takes better quality pictures in DARK.- IN low light camera is like a day without a laugh (USELESS) FINALLY! An android 5.0 phone that works with Android Auto.UPDATE 12/07/15:Disappointing that the supposed \"Flagship\" does not support voice dialing on it\\'s own. I know, you can use Google, but shouldn\\'t BLU have put it into this model. Several reviews seem to think it does have this function, but Customer Support says NO.No promise of OS upgrades per CS either. Another of BLU\\'s issues, especially on it\\'s Flagship model. EXCELLENT PRODUCT ALL OK This product sucks I buyed a month ago and is not working the internal memory stop working and doesn\\'t have warranty i have to drop in the trash don\\'t buy this cellphone please The phone works fine but wont hold charge the battery drain very fast, I fully charged night before in the morning the battery only has%30 .it has also over heat problem. Everything is as it says, $G S5 SM-G900F Unlocked, All New and in perfect conditions, so happy with the smartphone The phone itself was fine, but it Verizon wasn\\'t able to set up service on it. perfect... I am a late adopter. I am such a late adopter that I don\\'t have a data plan but jump from wi-fi to wi-fi spot. I need a phone with solid hardware and simple tasks like listen to podcast. The phone battery needs to be charged daily. My ex BLU phone needed charging every 3 days. Most of the battery energy is consumed by Google Play services which I don\\'t use often ( no data plan ) but oh well. Is my first OLED phone so I\\'m impressed with the graphics. The mechanics of this phone are pleasant ( weight, size, responsiveness ). put the chip in, turned it on and it is done. It is running since then. No issues. The person I gave it i svery happy with the large keys. Nice disposable phone for the price. Excelente Great gadget. Being unlocked works like a charm with any cell provider. Hotspot function is a Major plus. Love it. This is a great phone. so far is amazing, fast, awesome screen. I haven\\'t try the unlocked since I need new Sim card, now it uses the nano simple card, but I\\'m expecting to work. I bought this used and i was really nervous because it was such a huge purchase. NEXTDAYTECH really took care of me. props to them. the phone is exactly like they described and they gave me a wall adaptor and charger Breaks down very fast The cell phone but they send to me has a 9GB of internal memory and the cell phone i liked it is the 16GB Gracia Thank you Two weeks after receiving my Moto G4 Plus, the device will shut off at random. By shut off, I mean the screen goes completely black, and any sound that may have been playing while listening to music or watching a video cuts out as well. This happens regardless of how much of a charge the phone has, and may even occur while plugged in and charging. I have power cycled the device, cleared the cache partition, and tried booting up in safety mode to no avail. Having owned a Moto G 2nd & 3rd generation, in addition to a Nexus 6, I am extremely disappointed. I don\\'t believe it is just a coincidence that after Lenovo purchased Motorola and began to slowly phase out the Motorola name that I buy this latest model and have such trouble with it. I am very satisfied with this phone, good phone for this price and I would give a thumbs up to anyone who is thinking of getting a great phone for a reasonable price. It\\'s excellent Product came exactly as described and would recommend getting this if you like yourself a galaxy s3 and I would give this product a 5 star I\\'m not entirely sure where to begin. I\\'ve never left a review before so bear with me.I only need two simple things from a phone, battery life and reception. That\\'s all. I don\\'t need the internet. I don\\'t need Twitter or Facebook. In a world where smartphones are ever on the rise, I suppose I must be an oddity. Now, I\\'ll admit, the need for a full QWERTY keyboard is a recent one. I\\'ve managed, up until a few years ago, to never send a text and I\\'m well into my late thirties. I\\'ve never really seen the use of it all, myself. One leads to another and another when all it would have taken is a simple two minute phone call. Of course, that was all before I got my current job and low and behold I was reborn a texter. I really do hope my boss is proud of herself.Still, regardless of the new changes, some things remain a constant necessity. Phones are first and foremost for making calls. As I don\\'t need the internet, Nokia has always been my go to company. Why buy a smartphone when it\\'s not needed? This is my fifth phone with Nokia and I\\'m afraid to say that it will likely be my last. Before I get to the simple whys, however, I wish to contradict myself for a moment. This is a marvelous device. The build quality is superb. You can tell Nokia put a great deal of time with the building of the E6. The sturdy metal frame and the Gorilla Glass are testaments to that. And while some may groan and complain about Symbian being outdated, to me it is still a reliable and dependable OS.So, why will I be shortly listing this device on ebay you ask? I have two simple words for you, call quality. Notice I don\\'t say reception. Nokia still holds the reigns in that department in my humble opinion. And, in battery life too while we\\'re on the subject. I always got at least two days out my device and that was with heavy talking and texting. But, since the purchase of this phone, I\\'m consistently asked to repeat myself, often told that I\\'m difficult to hear and understand. These complaints have vanished recently as I\\'ve sadly moved, temporarily, to a Blackberry Bold. As I am on the front line for my company, often being it\\'s only face for our customers, this is unacceptable.Sadly, Nokia, I regret that we must part ways. I hope you\\'re able to turn things around for yourselves as, in my eyes, you\\'re still the best.A disappointed customer Thanks for everything excelente Beautiful, huge screen. All the apps you need now. Lots of cool features but you may have to go on YouTube and watch videos to learn them all. please notice, sprint only This phone has been nothing but trouble. I had to replace the battery twice within like 3 months, I finally gave up and spent MORE money on a different phone-- not worth it. Product damaged The phone arrived on time and it worked as expected. Very nice product and service. I\\'d recommend the article and the vendor. Overall this phone is not for me. It has a few great features though. Way to expensive for what you get.It is too small for me and I don\\'t like not being able to delete the apps I do not use.I suggest watching the videos on youtube before you buy one. My son loves the lg gr500 phone. It is affordable and meets his needs. It is brand new and cheaper than having a contract with a cell phone company which charges $100 to replace a cell phone. It gets shipped quickly and is unlocked so all I have to do is get a new sim card from my cell phone company which is free. Phone is with Sprint Prepaid Hi, thanks for your service and I\\'m questions I am happy with the purchase, excellent product. Item met my expectations Excellent and fast shipping I love this phone. Bought it for my son in jamaica. I know he\\'s going to love it. I\\'ve send him pics. Thank you Perfect Color - Mineral BlackI am transitioning from Oneplus 3 to Xperia XZ. I am satisfied with the performance my current phone but I am making this shift to XZ only for the design aspect and camera. I have been waiting so long for Sony to release an all rounder phone that can compete with other flagships in the market and this time they nailed it.Pros:Performance: Crisp and fast without any lag.Design: IMO, this is the best looking handset among the current flagships(including iphone 7 and pixel). It\\'s been 3 days since I started using it, and it had already drawn attention from my friends. In one word it will put all the flagships to shame. Thumbs up for the mineral black color.Camera: Manual mode is a killer. Auto focus and video quality is also good. Indoor and low light shots are great if you can tweak little bit in the manual mode.Fingerprint sensor: If you can spend some time and flash the software with UK version, then you will probably unearth one of the amazing and effective finger print sensors in the market. It seems to respond faster than iphone6s, iphone 7 and oneplus 3.Display: Nothing to complain.Speakers: Dual speaker are really cool.SD Card: Not yet installed a micro sd card. So could not comment on that yet.Water proof: Have not tested and no intentions to do it.Cons:Battery: Its just satisfactory. I use my phone quite a bit during day(at least 2 hour talk time, 3 hours of listening music, 1 hour of bluetooth streaming in the car, 2 hours of browsing, social networking and video streaming combined). An extra 10% could have been better in my case.Wish list:Charging Time: Oneplus3 and Pixel has fast charge option that can charge 60% of the phone in 30 mins. I miss that feature in Xperia XZ. It usually takes 60 minutes for 60% charge.Overall: Sony has finally hit the cord by packing all the best and cool features into one single handset XZ. Be it camera, display, performance, fingerprint sensor or dual speakers it perfected each of those features. Price wise it is on the higher end of the spectrum competing with Samsung and Apple. Sony is a premium brand which uses finest materials. It is perceived as an upscale brand even before apple started working on it\\'s ipods. At the same time I would not waste money if they deliver incompetent products(which is the case of some of their earlier xperias).But if a Sony product can compete with Samsung and Apple then I would not mind paying the premium. If you don\\'t want to be one in millions using Iphones and Samsungs and yet do not compromise on quality and performance then the answer is \"Own an Xperia XZ\". I am very happy I deal with you, the product is excellent good, its fine cell phone thanks you. i love my new phone. The phone has more problems then I thought. But came fast which I loved so a 7.5 out of 10 Good product It was exactly as seller described and works beautifully ! Could not be more leased with it , and a good price. Good product, in description everything as this is. This is a great phone with affordable cost. I don\\'t mind the bloat wares as long as they help keep the cost down. Just remove or ignore the bloat wares. I like the Power and Boost button that release unused memory instantly. It works great with official ASUS flip cover case. Simply close cover to put into sleep and open cover to wake it up. (I don\\'t use the fingerprint security). There are flip cover cases by other manufacturers, but be aware that not all of them can make phone sleep/wake automatically. grrrrrr... the phone came...i wet to at&t...they said the phone was stolen... phone not activatible.... -100000 stars. Muy buen producto It\\'s awsome. I love it :) I\\'ve owned this phone for 8 weeks and now it randomly restarts several times per day. And resetting all the customization. It\\'s worthless, especially when it happens when you are about to take a picture then lose the shot. Service was good and fast, just not the product. Best of the best. There is no question in my mind that Microsoft leads now in innovation and design. I got my first Lumia 520 as a temporary replacement for a malfunctioning iPhone and it was love at the first sight. Now I got this 640 Xl, its mine not like an iPhone or others and it is wonderfully designed, fast operating system and great battery life. Ordered and came in less than 1 week. Installed my microsim from ATT and it was running smoothly. The only issue was it came from China or HK and everything the screen instructions were in chinese...so I got in YouTube and found a clip explaining how to change the language to english and with a little bit of imagination it took me a couple minutes to do it. The double sim card is going to be handy since we travel overseas and I am sick of ATT overpriced rates. By the way both cards appear to be \"active\" so I will be able to choose and pick on the go which phone number to use. Another little issue is that the charger that came with the phone is a weird one ( I think I have seen this type in the UK) so I use another USB cable but it must be a thick one like my Surface 3 otherwise there is a message that the charging process will be slow. By the way, no need of expensive cases unless you are prone to dropping things. The 640 XL fits perfectly in my jeans front pockets.So...it is a great phone and trust me..I am a recovering appleholic that still hangs to his iPad mini but now is sold to the idea that for now the future in technology and design is in Microsoft.Five stars because this phone is more that what I was expecting and now ai am ready for W10 Great phone. 64GB of Internal Memory. 4GB of RAM. It\\'s good specs wise but the phone heats up all the time. Even doing the simplest of things like researching stuff on the internet to playing basic games. And when you play big games like Clash of Clans it just turns into a heater. I can feel the heat through my phone case. Maybe it\\'s the thermal paste they used or something but it doesn\\'t work. Other than the heating issue it is great. Excelente It was a great device but the sound needs improving. To \"Prepaid Mobile Partners\" who sold this product to me,I did send you three return requests in last two weeks. No response so far.It does not make any sense at all for you to sell this crappy phone that always shows the \"Sim Card Error\" message. It doesn\\'t accept prepaid T-Mobile or Sprint sim cards. Technically, I need to unlock it.So who did you sell this one to me. Is the way you do your business?I want my money back!!!TJ A gift for my wife & she is very happy with it!!! The phone is labeled \"new\" but it\\'s refurbished. It\\'s a second hand phone label as new! Unbelievable! !! I wasn\\'t able to activate it since cricket changes systems A little short on memory (4Gb) but Windows Mobile OS doesn\\'t require much.Compact budget phone that gets the job done without breaking the bank.As with any budget phone, a little slow for things like touch response, but overall dos AOK.Just temper your expectations - it\\'s not a Galaxy S6 or a high end WP so don\\'t compare to one. nice for its price Great phone so far. A physical booklet would have helped as opposed to getting online. So far it is fun to use. This is my second POSH and my second smartphone. I upgraded because I wanted GPS. My sister is going to take my old Pegasus which is still functioning fine. I love my Titan, definately a crisper display and camera, but most of all it is super fast. I have to get my data working on it though. I don\\'t think it is the phone, I think it is something with configuring and setting it up. Had to do something special with the pegasus too to get it set up. Chatting now with my carrier to see if they can help me. It is a very large screen, so I am going to gift my ASUS tablet to someone as I really don\\'t need it anymore. This phone is faster than my tablet. Good product. Great phone , loved it. It was all I was expecting from HTC . Great display, great audio , very fast and the best of all is that It has the best design of ALL android goooood iphone It came broken. Battery is overheating. Home button doesn\\'t work. It was a gift and it was sent far away so I can\\'t return it anymore. Very disappointed! thaaaaaaaaaanx... I bought this phone for over six months for use in Venezuela and until now I\\'m very happy with its performance: it is very easy to use, economical, quick Internet connection and the battery lasts several days despite continuous use ... I give a rating of 5/5 ... Thanks Amazon and Nokia .. J. Briceño below $100. it is a steal. I have no complains. Good It had a piece broken that was not on description. Phone is great love it. And its pink:) Good Excellent Quality Product for the best price./..Unlocked...hence can use with any carriers...Very good bargain for the price its being offered.....very much recommended.. Thank you for an excellent product. Highly recommend this seller! excelente producto bought it for my mom shes very happy💋❤❤❤ Works great. I love the phone!!! It\\'s light and a great size.👍 I got it in two days. Super! Great love it..sim card slot was too small but that\\'t something which could be fixed by cutting the simcard.....great phone i love it!!.....remember to charge the phone before using it! compre mi producto nuevo y me llego dañado no tiene señal con ninguna de las casas telefonicas de venezuela en todos lados me dicen que es el amplificador de señal y el producto es (nuevo) Vert good Excellent for the price. Better than what I was expecting. Runs smoothly, charges quickly, battery holds for 1.5-2 days. Much better than my old Nexus 4.The only missing feature is NFC. I\\'ve never used these feature in my old phone, anyway.It\\'s really slim, light and ofcourse gorgeous. 64GB of memory, 16 MP camera and fingerprint unlocking, all for $299.I would definitely buy it again and will look forward to the new versions. The G1S works for me in the US. Will try it in France soon.But it might make sense to wait for the G2 model.....Update: I have now tried it in France (Paris and Corsica) : works very well. Awesome phone for the price. It meets all my needs! For anyone that doesn\\'t have to have the latest and greatest this is the phone you want to get. Great product as good or better than original Great battery, doesn\\'t annoy me with notifications, higher app quality than Android. Digitizer broke in my pocket. I weigh 140 lbs with a case on the phone. Substandard construction makes it too flexible. Tech supports says I can\\'t even have it fixed by the manufacturer. no change Great little phone...... Able to use for calls and texts while in Cuba ...good buy I purchased this phone as a replacement phone for my son. Works with my current Verizon plan and I was able to connect with no problems. Very happy with this phone. However, loses a star because of the overheating which sometimes causes the phone to shut off and factory reset. Good solid case. The wallet portion can hold 2 of my cards easily. I like that door part of the wallet has the ability to hold a card or ID. The included pocket mirror is a nice touch. Perfect still I love my phone Phone is great so far! No complaints. The charger, however- with my very FIRST time plugging it in and unplugging, the whole top (thumb) part slid off lol. Everything is pretty good other than that. Thanks so much! This phone is NOT un-locked even though it was advertised like so. When I got the phone from Amazon, there was small piece of paper inside telling the phone had been unlocked for me and to unlock it I was told to open the T-Mobile App in the phone. I tried using that app to unlock, but it failed.Called LG Support - they told they would not be able to do it. Called T-Mobile Support - they also told they would not be able to unlock it.Now I don\\'t have any other option but to return the phone.So much wastage of time - Hate it!!! I received it .. And everything works great Bottom right of my screen doesn\\'t sense touch well at all. The phone has been freezing and lagging pretty badly. It has been a little over a month I believe so I don\\'t think I can return it, I may check with Motorola however.The phone size is nice and you can play games without much of a problem. I am not a fan of the camera. With this phone, more pixels does NOT mean better quality. The quality is mediocre at best.The phone storage is expandable which is convenient if you like having music, videos, books, or audiobooks on your phone. The phone build feels lightweight, but it feels like a quality phone. I am frustrated however with the sudden freezes and lagging. I believe this is a good phone for the price, but I also believe Motorola can do better than this! I specifically ordered an AT&T phone but received a t mobile carrier phone. Not cool at all. Wife and I have been living with a flip phone for so long now, that batteries for it are more expensive than this phone. So we decided to upgrade and get a \\'smart\\' phone. Our kids will be so surprised... that we can operate it that is.We have PureTALK and took the SIM card out of the old phone and into this one. I had to get PureTALK to send a reset code out to my SIM and then set 4G off on the phone, then it started to work. Lots of apps to use immediately and more to just load this thing up.Now that we know it\\'s a good match for us, I just placed an order for a second phone for my use.$50 for a phone and $15 a month for PureTALK is all we pay in cell phone use. Good phone for the price nothing to fancy just your basic smart phone with android os Good Shipped perfectly. Using flawlessly for months on end. Would suggest buying a SIM card with it unless you live close to a Spring store, I had to make three trips to get it working properly. However, that isn\\'t the buyer\\'s fault, Sprint just has a s***ty way to do everything. 10/10 phone is very sleek and attractive. very light in the hands.. set up was a cakewalk.. android 5.0 preinstalled. pretty quick response time .. overall impressed with this phone. has gotten a little warm with heavy use but nothing extreme like noted in some of the other reviews, completely happy with my choice.. my last phone was a galaxy s4 active. so to still be impressed.. it says alot. i would so make the same decision again Nice good very niceThanks so much bad camera, procesor is to hot, bad speakers, my phone was unlocked and had scratches Shut down minutes after unboxing. Won\\'t stay on for more than a few minutes. Thank I have owned several unlocked phones, moto g, moto x, and a couple of others, this by far the best phone I have owned. It is very fast, has enough capacity, and is expandable via an SD card. Some of the complaints I have read are about the EMUI interface, if you do not like it, just load the Google Now launcher from the Google playstore and basically you have almost stock android phone.Fingerprint reader is fast, camera is very good with advanced capabilities, battery life is excellent (full day) and some other cool features, like IR remote control, eye comfort mode, and ultra battery mode. This phone didn\\'t last me a week after purchasing. I had gotten it set up and been using it for a few days before it gave out, I never dropped it or got it wet, I simply let it die ONCE and it never turned back on. I tried everything, and even found complaints of the same problem online, I finally gave up. I pull it out every now and then to see if it will charge and I\\'ve had no luck. Bought a used phone from seller and it had very minor scuff marks on the back of the phone. Flashed it to the nightly Cyanogen Mod 11 rom and works great.Phone was almost double on ebay.Great phone for Straight Talk ATT or T-Mobile micro sim card from Walmart will work. Just a few lines to endorse what I think was very helpful service, which is too rare sometimes. I had a few personal challenges which meant I had to edit my order, and I am totally impressed with the assistance I got from The Wireless Circle which made it way less problematic than I expected.Thanks Wireless Circle! Bueno very fast Good phone love it I\\'ve been using this phone for a couple of days now, and after watching, reading, and hearing all these reviews as well as feedback from others, I had an idea of what to expect going into purchasing this device.I saw a few have issues with the phone bending, similar to the iPhone 6 Plus when that first released. I\\'ve been babying it and taking care of the phone as much as possible, and in that time I\\'ve fallen in love. My personal experience is the UI is nice and clean, similar to stock Android with a few added extras, and it\\'s very responsive. I know it\\'s not 4K all the time, and until the Marshmallow update releases, there won\\'t be much support as of yet, however the up scaling of videos in the YouTube app still look simply amazing. The camera isn\\'t really want most hyped it up to be, but I find that it works well and edges out my Note 4 and my father\\'s iPhone 6S Plus, which is perfect enough for me.From the general feel of the build quality, I\\'d have to mark Sony down as the \"Apple\" of Androids, since I haven\\'t personally felt that the other Android devices did it for me. I tried the Note 5, S6 Edge Plus, iPhone 6S Plus, Nexus 6P, and multiple others, but the Xperia takes the cake in feeling the most premium to me. Calls sound crystal clear, and the front facing speakers, while not as powerful as some HTC or Motorola phones, still sound much better than my previous iPhone.All in all, love the device, hope Sony continues to push out updates for it in the future, and I may stick with them should they continue producing this type of quality into their devices. It didn\\'t say it was the duos version and that was disappointing, beside the security seal arrived broken. Best phone for this year. I had a Samsung S3 and later a Samsung S4. I thought about to buy a Samsung S5 but in all reviews LG G3 is best phone. I took the risk and I\\'m not disappointed. Minor blemishes on the back for a \"New Factory Unlocked GSM IPhone 5C\" but all in all I\\'m satisfied buen telefono I need some help in order to use all its facilites. Supposed to be brand new. Wasn\\'t. Wouldn\\'t charge. This is an unlocked, international version of the Samsung Galaxy S6 Edge phone. Do not be alarmed when you read the package instructions that it must be activated in a country other than the one in which you reside. The instructions for my phone indicated that I needed to first use the phone in a Southeast Asian country, but I went to the local AT&T store to get a new SIM card (because this phone requires a smaller SIM card than my previous Nexus 5), and the phone worked in the U.S. immediately.I thought that I would use the \"edge\" notifications a lot more than I do. In fact, I find that I wish I had purchased the flat-screen Samsung Galaxy S6 instead. That said, I\\'m quite pleased with the performance of this phone. i know samsung battery is not thaaaat good compared to others but this device has a 3300 mAh battery (!!!!) it was supposed to be a really good one. it was getting super hot at first and i was like wtf. anyway it\\'s ok now and i really love it. oh! the calender keeps crashing :/ actually it never worked. so im giving 3 stars. For this price range..this is excellent phone. Iam using this phone for daily normal use. No issues. But one design issue. Wrong placement of power button. Very average battery life. I was fooled by the item description. It was totally below expectations. I could not even use the phone. Seems that they were just trying to place a broken phone to innocent buyers... Excellent phone very happy with it came with iOS 8.1.2 so I\\'m able to jailbreak it Wonderful flip phone! Unlocked version. The only reason I did not give this a 5 star rating is because the camera is low quality but is IS a phone! Pretty, easy to read and easy to navigate! I would definitely order this again! It glitch after a while of use... I like the first version better plus the screen is way too small I purchased this phone because it was unlocked and I could use it with my tracfone account. Of course, it took tracfone several tries to get the settings correct so I could use it as a phone. . As a phone it works fine, I have been dropped a few times but overall not bad. I do not use 90% of the apps that came on the phone. Therefore I cannot comment on them.I found that the only unlocked sim cards they make for this phone is 4G. Granted it has two slots but if you install additional apps 4G is not that much space. The sim cards are larger than the normal sim cards sold in most stores and I am still looking for larger capacity. If anyone know of 8G or larger sim cards that will fit in this phone, please let me know. I purchased this phone looking for an upgrade to my old 900. The phone I received was a 3g only variant and I was on a 4g plan. I wasn\\'t even aware that there was a 3g only version when I purchased this phone. The description no where stated that it was 3g only. Returned the phone. GREAT I purchased this phone for one of my sons. He is a heavy user of its cell phone and he is completely happy with it. He was using an iPhone 3gs and the Galaxy Alpha implied a huge improvement.for him. All the applications run very fast and it works with the 4G (LTE) network, which is pretty much faster than the 3G network. Great phone. excelente Great phone put in at&t sim and it was go to go.Works very well.Love it well worth the money.24 month warranty also. amazing phone - great deal First off I was sceptical on this purchase but now that I have it and activated it through straight talk Verizon it works like a charm. The camera is great! I love taking photos with it! I definitely recommend it to people being as it\\'s got a good screen size and it never lags. Definitely will buy again if ever needed. Especially if they bring out a new generation. Definitely 5 star worthy to me. Price was great and arrived quickly. Works for internet sharing. Excelente producto. Fue entregado en el tiempo previsto y funciona perfectamente en Venezuela. Tiene dos semanas de uso y no ha presentado ningùn problema... Phone is a good Blackberry and had no problems with the phone itself or getting onto my local phone network, just dropped in my SIM and up and running ... Not much else to sayEdit:It has been several months now and phone has preformed flawlessly, could not be happier. The phone came in alright condition. It has scratches and dings on. BUT it does not come with a SIM and it is not clearly noted on the description. Make sure you have a SIM because it\\'s a huge pain to get one! Two to three weeks shipping for me. It is a really nice phone, looks nice, works well. And it is cheap compare to other cell phone Came faster then expected, thanks cellathon. I\\'ve used androids and iPhones, so this is the first time I used a Windows phone. So as I\\'ll be using this as my work phone, I\\'ll be learning and getting use to the phone. Excellent phone... all Android software works perfect! Full configuration. Battery very good if some apps. are well configured. Great phone fast delivery! Definitely will recommend Excelente SMART PHONES ARE NOT ALWAYS SMART AND I DO NOT WANT A SMART PHONE AND I LIKE THIS FLIP STYLE WITH LETTERS TO TYPE This was fraud on my account I\\'m from Argentina and this phone is excellent, i love it! Works great and it\\'s very easy to handle. The screen resolution is amazing as well as the cam. I\\'m very happy with my purchase. I\\'d like to thank the seller who delivered it asap and in excellent conditions. i love Was pleasantly surprised by this phone. Excellent screen color. Bright. Phone is zippy and I love the ribbed back. Great condition, although it comes without headphones (i don\\'t mind, the apple ear pods hurt my ears anyways) But it also DOES NOT come with a SIM card. So I ordered one from a third party on amazon but also was seeing their reviews from other customers and gotten worried. I ended up trying to talk to an AT&T associate online not only ending up wasting my time because the site wasn\\'t working because I followed his directions yet, ended up on the same page and wouldn\\'t add the free SIM card to my cart. So basically I have to wait until the 30th or even maybe the 5th on July to get this iPhone activated. Its good that i bought this phone though because my old iPhone 4 was starting to die on me. Great features; perfect weight and size; fast and responsive - when not frozen! The phone regularly freezes and, way too often, will not wake up from sleep mode. I am constantly rebooting the phone. Became a hazard when needing to make an emergency call. Shopping for a replacement now. Shame - I really wanted to love this phone. LOVE THE PHONE ! BUT THE VOLUME IS HORRIABLE VERY LOW ! ONLY HEAR IF SOMEONE IS CALLING IF THE PHONE IS RIGHT IN FRONT OF ME AND IF THERE IS NO SURROUNDING SOUND OR NOISE. OTHERWISE I WOULD HAVE GIVEN 5 STARS BECAUSE I LOVE ALL OTHER FEATURES. good works great, no issues I\\'ve had this phone for almost a month now, and I love it! I would recommend it to anyone, I had the boost mobile before this phone and the phone I had was the LG stylo the phone is just a little bit bigger but this blu phone is so much better! I have so much more room on this phone for my apps. Before I had like 3 or 4 apps total before I\\'d get that little thing saying my space was low ugh, I was always having to download apps then uninstall over and over again, it was a pain but now I have like 4 games my audible app with all my books my Amazon Kindle app with all my other books and of course my Google Books with more books. I had none of those on my other phone to much space. Oh that was another thing to I couldn\\'t use my memory SD card to save some of my apps to, but I\\'m able to almost all them with this phone. The only problems I have with the phone are not really problems for me, the camera isn\\'t the greatest but it takes pictures and there decent. Also when I listen to music it isn\\'t as loud as I like it but I have an mp3 player so it\\'s fine. Anyway if your debating this phone I\\'d say go for it! But like other have said it\\'s not iPhone or galaxy but compared to the prepaid phones I\\'ve had this thing is way closer then any others I\\'ve had ( LG volt, LG stylo, aquos crystal) and I have had iPhone, galaxy s3 and s5 hope this helps! its just a basic phone. need lot of improvement and basic feature like compass etc. front camera picture quality is poor does not feel like 2M pix Great phone! II had a HTC One V. Using the HTC One M8 is like entering a new world. Very good and powerful phone. The charging port went out after 6 months. But, dealing with BLU was a very pleasant experience. They replaced it with a better phone, no questions asked. But, I love the phone! Great reception and this phone is fast! no quiere cargar bad battery life leaves something to be desired, but other than that I couldn\\'t be happier! I have some trouble with a independent seller and the order was canceled but after the reorder through amazon direct handling everything was ok.... Great phone it works very well as i traveled to mexico real good deal. I have had it for 5 months I don\\'t know if it is software or hardware problem but the battery drains pretty fast and the phones heats a lot. Works great! Love these things and Amazon;) thank you great phones as I bought 4 of them at varying times for family members and everyone is satisfied and loves the phone. On a recent outing and trying to find the right turn to make on the road, one of my grandson\\'s used his phone to navigate us right to the exact location and it was way out in the boondocks, so It was well worth it that time. So far I enjoy this device does everything I needed it to do. I would definitely keep shopping with amazon Wireless hub were really great , the phone is amazing Just got it and i don\\'t know if its the battery or the phone but it wont hold a charge or charge properly. I\\'ve tried several chargers and it happens to all of them, it won\\'t charge anymore past the battery % of when i plugged it in. Very upset, and now i have to go through more trouble of trying to return and get a new one. Not ordering from this company again and wouldn\\'t recommend them. I really love this phone but when I bought it after like a month the phone camera stopped working suddenly as well as the flashlight which is a real bummer. I have to go fix it next week Thursday or Friday so yeah that\\'s it Arrived quickly and works well, looks brand new to help the people find the stuff that fullfil their expectations, excellent orientation .. .. . . . . . This phone is not completly unlocked as annunced. It was unable to be used in Venezuela because it is supposed that you have to introduce a network password. Do not buy this product if you wanna use it in other country Bought it for my wife last month. It\\'s working smoothly since then. Finger print scanner works very accurate and pretty fast, its advantage is that now kids don\\'t get to use her phone. Camera picture quality is fine, neither of us is a camera enthusiasts so it works with us. Speakers are quite loud and sound it pretty good to ears. Build is pretty good, doesn\\'t feel cheap in hand. Had it for a couple of weeks now. Looks like stock Android, which is great. Comes with everything you need, including a bumper case and screen protector, which is above and beyond. Everything seems to load up pretty quickly, including websites. Battery seems to last a couple of days at least if it\\'s not being used, which is great.Pros:+ Price! Half the price of most unlocked phones.+ Android 4.4 Kit Kat, and BLU says they\\'ll be doing upgrades to Lollipop in June, so basically the latest version of Android.+ Removable Battery! Thank GOD! It\\'s nice to be able to replace the battery yourself and give the phone to your kids. Or just buy a bigger one without depending on someone to open the phone up. This is the way it should be. Phones don\\'t need to be thinner than this anyways.+ Bumper case, screen protector and even pretty comfortable earbuds with remote and mic are included.Cons:- Unfortunately, every emergency number is programmed in, including 123, which is my provider\\'s voicemail number. I found a way around it, but it\\'s a little annoying.- Can\\'t find any alternative cases to purchase for it, but the included bumper case seems to be more than sufficient, so no biggie.- Hardware buttons not back-lit. A little harder to use in the dark. Can be remedied with software apps, however.- \"Video-Call\" camera seemed a little weak, but this will be used very little anyways. The normal camera, however, took some great photos.- Voice on speakerphone didn\\'t sound so great. But again, probably won\\'t be used that much at all. Using the phone normally sounds fine.To me, this is probably as complete as a budget smartphone as you can get. This might make me jump off of the iOS bandwagon completely. The phone is nice but they didn\\'t give me a charger that works at where I live. That was really disappointing. Excelente Great phone. Camera is amazing, but sometimes the software lags. Hopefully software updates sort that out. The fingerprint scanner is BLISTERING fast and 100% accurate. Feels great in the hand, love the \\'smaller\\' form factor and phones less than HUGE are getting hard to find. Battery is what kept me from giving it 5 stars. If you have the money, and want the pure Android experience, go for the 6p. If not, this is a very capable phone and you will love it. Best phone I have ever owned. Windows 8 truly shines on devices. I will never be going back to Droid. Phone is working perfectly, very good buy no regrets Phone arrived in perfect condition and as expected. However, these phones are not well built and I have had to have several repairs made to the phone without inflicting actual damage. Sometimes my screen won\\'t work, the home button is falling out, vibration sometimes will suddenly not work - all within the first few months of having the phone. I have used iPhones for several years but this will be my last one. Making the switch as soon as possible. Excellent Love the color! Really practical to carry documents. Simply all good but could use longer battery life Super great phone. Had a note 4 but wanted something water proof after some close calls. Don\\'t miss the note 4 a bit. my sister and i bought this phone for my mom and she loves it! Very good started phone for someone who does not know cell phones very well..lol Stopped charging after one week. Not impressed. Great seller. I asked them about whether the refurbished phone had any scratches on the screen or back and frame. I was told that if I purchased a phone from them, they would send me a nice clean phone. After much thought and research, I decided to purchase the LG Optimus G Pro E980. Really fast delivery and to my shock and surprise, the phone I received, looked like a brand new phone. Came with a case, charger, USB cable. No manual, but I downloaded one off the LG site. It is a beautiful phone and works great! Exceptional camera and tons of apps. Only con is speaker distorts at really high volume. But, I still I highly recommend this phone and the seller. AGAIN GREAT SELLER. I wouldnt connect to any sever junk I bought this phone as a gift for my friend who lives overseas. The phone arrived promptly and it was in a mint condition. I couldn\\'t figure out how to charge it (connecting the charger just wouldn\\'t do anything) and thus turn it on. But after googling the subject and playing with different variations of reset, and taking out the battery a few times, it started charging fine. (This problem never popped up again and I am still not sure what exactly was the reason for not charging in the first place).I personally like the Android OS much better (I own a Samsung Galaxy Tab 10.1 and also have used the S2 for quite a few days) but I still prefer to stick with the iPhone (as far as smartphone). It takes better pictures and feels more solid overall. (Whereas the Galaxy S2 is very lite and made of cheap plastic). NEVER AGAIN ! Arrived on time and product is exactly as expected. I did not see much difference between s5 and s4 except s5 crashed several time when using internet . There is no more exciting options for photo editing tool. Another annoying thing is some extra apps were automatically installed when starting from factory setting. Default Language is Germany. The date showed in \\'phone hidden\\' bar back to year of 2013. A little bit confusing about this product. Quality phone, but does not come with Android 4.4 as indicated by the title, mine came with Android 5.1 installed. In my case this is important. The phone is a good phone bit I got a 2900 battery instead of 3000 This pone does not work on Verizon network. It appeared from all that I read about it that it was supposed to. Very disappointed 16 year old girl on Christmas. ....they should have full coverage for the phone, I dropped it on carpet cuz someone bumped me and they won\\'t do nothing about it, sounds dumb to me. Great phone, has Withstood quite a bit of abuse, The phone is very nice and holds a charge well. I don\\'t like that the keyboard is different from my other phone. The other one was so much easier to type on. Great Android phone and a great deal through Virgin Mobile. If you have good reception from Virgin Mobile (Sprint) in your area, I would definitely recommend this phone. Fast processor and a beautiful screen. Phone is great. Everything works just fine. Works like $500 Android but with dual SIM.Occasionally have to reboot by removing battery when switch fails to respond.Super thin and has started to bend like new iPhones! si cumplieronnn I broke my work phone and needed a new one quickly and they responded right away when i reached out to them. Got my phone promptly and in the condition described. The only thing was, the earbuds were missing which I didn\\'t really care about. To me, it was the best priced phone of its value that was compatible with Verizon. It has 64 gigs, runs fast, is way more powerful than all my colleague\\'s samsungs. When I want to upgrade, I\\'m definitely going to see what this seller has available first. Received my xperia Z3+ :). Item as described, super fast shipping. Worked successfully with T-Mobile nano sim card. Had to adjust the settings on the device a little bit on Network provider, but it did work!. LTE signal worked. Call T-Mobile customer service in case you have any issues with the connection, since it should work well in the US. Completely satisfied with my purchase. A+++++ Realmente es un teléfono muy útil y divertido para quienes necesitamos un tlf tipo PDA (sin necesitar de muchas aplicaciones tontas de juegos y otras que los niños u otros mas jóvenes estarían interesados). Se conecta a las wi-fi de manera muy rápida y fácil y ademas con una conexión de datos bastante rápida también. Sin embargo uso el FB, el Whatsapp, ESPNsoccernet y otros de manera habitual y satisfactoriamente.Es de notar, que al ser un tlf de pantalla táctil no es para ser usado por quienes andamos apurados pues a la hora de buscar un contacto o un numero de la agenda resulta algo incomodo(pero esto sucede con todos los teléfonos de la categoría). El teléfono tiene un teclado qwerty muy práctico que permite escribir de manera muy eficiente. La cámara es buena para los espacios abiertos y soleados, regular para los entornos cerrados y con luz artificial a pesar de los múltiples intentos por configurarla correctamente.En otros aspectos, hay ciertos detalles que deberían poder ser cambiados (pero al menos, hasta ahora no he logrado). Uno de ellos y muy importante es poder ver los números de tlf de cada contacto al momento de ver los registros y de hacer una llamada. Esto es practico porque por lo general, siempre interesa verlo para identificar la operadora a la que haremos la llamada (porque para quienes usamos planes prepagados puede resultar en un gasto mayor al llamar una operadora diferente a la que estamos afiliados).Por otra parte, si les interesa pueden hacer algunos ajustes para evitar consumir batería inútilmente. Entre ellos, desactivar el sensor de movimiento (que hace rotar la pantalla de manera automática y aun cuando no lo queremos). También pueden cambiar el tiempo que dura la pantalla encendida después de dejar el tlf en standby (dura unos 60 segundos de manera predeterminada y pueden reducirlo hasta 5 segundos). La conexión de datos también debe colocarse en la opción \"cuando es necesario) de otra forma siempre estará conectado.Del resto, creo que no se sentirán decepcionados. En verdad es muy bueno! Eso si, no lo usen al conducir porque aparte de ser indebido, será casi imposible por el hecho de ser táctil y realmente nadie quiere que suceda algo malo por ello.Saludos desde Venezuela. BlackBerry Classic Q20 is my second BlackBerry Smart Phone after using BlackBerry Q10.\\xa0Blackberry Q10 Unlocked Cellphone, 16GB, BlackI\\'ve used BlackBerry Q10 for a while but Q10 is a little slow when I used application from Android OS and I felt stuffy while web surfing because of its small screen! so I want BlackBerry Smart phone with wider screen and better specification. So I bought this BlackBerry Class for ME!1. AppearanceWhen I saw this first, I was really excited about its semblance. right. I cannot help saying about its appearance. BlackBerry Class is for \\'Design\\' (or \\'just Design\\' in a certain sense). I really like its design. it bring a nobleman or a person who work in specialized job to my mind. really cool and professional! I want you to see the left side of blackberry class. there are two slot, one for micro sd card and one for sim. they are put over by pin which like iphone. the material used for slot and edge makes blackberry class more simple and classic!2. SoftwareBlackBerry Classic show us blackberry which approach Android OS. I can use application from Android store like google store or Amazon app store more smoothly. but still it uses blackberry OS. not faster like android phones, but quiet nice for using application or web surfing. the screen bigger than Q10 helps its pleasant environment.3. ElseI think the detail on this amazon page is not enough. this page have to show consumers the more information at least this blackberry classic is 100-4. this can make consumer to decide to buy or not, the core information.I like Blackberry but I want more innovation of Blackberry. Had it almost a week. No problems. Just put in my sum card from my s111 and no problem. Great case...and real sturdy... and thin enough to allow my iPhone 5S to fit comfortably in my pocket. Although the sender was very helpful the product was not compatible with my carrier Really cool, i love it. Good deal! This is the slowest, stupidest, most absolutely obnoxious phone I have ever used. It downloads unwanted content all of the time and it switches the date and time every time I answer the phone. I would never buy this phone again. excellent product but it was not what you expected, annex the expected product image OK. VERY GOOD. THANKS good afternoon I received the phone is locked does not recognize the card without my line is movistar sim trajeta says that is not compatible Excellent It\\'s used and there is some privete information in it. I can\\'t recover the PIN The best phone i ever had, nice camera and general performance. muy bueno I bought this phone so that I could have a phone with no internet, as partial \"unplug\" thing. It works great, although there are a few drawbacks. It has a very small SMS memory, so the inbox fills up pretty quickly. It doesn\\'t have a way to auto-delete oldest first, so you have to either delete everything, including your newest messages, or individually delete each older message, which gets time consuming. I text a lot, so that\\'s a big annoyance for me.I also wish that you could send it a picture via MMS (since there\\'s no data port and no internet, that leaves only MMS) to set as a background picture. Alas, it doesn\\'t handle MMS at all. That also makes receiving group messages nearly impossible, as most smartphones send group messages as MMS instead of SMS.Call quality is pretty good though, and it came with a handsfree wired (it doesn\\'t have bluetooth) headset.The SIM tray is easy to use; because it is a tray, not a slot, I was able to insert the micro-SIM from my smartphone without any trouble.Battery life is excellent. I took this on a business trip for two weeks, using it to text and talk for a couple hours each day, and only had to charge it a few times. So far it works perfectly. Battery life could be better, slim design is less important for me and probably for most people. Easy setup for dual SIM cards, you can choose freely which will use mobile data and assign contacts to SIMs. One SIM is micro the other is mini by the way. Might be difficult to use a micro SIM with an adapter in the mini SIM slot due to the design. Great phone! It charges quickly and responds immediately to commands. Good camera, also. Love the size. Love the features. Best thing to replace my blackberry. really good photos. Also it is Very simple to use. Excellent product!!!! But two of the couple years ago. works ok. I like the sliding part for texting purposes. it makes a great gift I purchased a LG G3 D851 32GB Black Smartphone for T-Mobile from you on December 5, 2015. The phone has echo issue when talking to people they can hear themselves and I can hear myself as I speak also.I contacted LG and based on the IMEI number this is a refurbished phone and had been sent in to them by T-mobile once for repair. This phone was manufactured back July 2014 and is 2 years old. There is no warranty on this phone. It is not a new phone as you implied. Now I am stuck with a product that does not work and for the most part not usable.Very Disappointed. Well I was stuck between paying for the Note 3 and being locked into a two year contract (or at least until the phone was paid off) through T-mobile or remaining contractless buy just outright buying a phone. I didn\\'t exactly have the extra funds available to just buy like a $700 phone. So, a co-worker told me about BLU phones. After checking out their website, I decided I wanted the BLU Pure Life XL. However, I was uneasy about forking over $400 for a phone by a company I had never heard of. After much debating with myself, I decided to get the BLU Life Pure.I have to give kudos to Amazon\\'s customer service. The first phone I ordered was stolen off my porch and Amazon sent me a replacement. It was a flawless process!Anyway, I\\'ve had the phone for a couple of days now and I love it! When the phone arrived, I popped my sim card from my Nexus 4 to the BLU Life Pure. It was quite simple. I had no issues putting my sim card in and it instantly started working on T-mobile\\'s network. I did pick up 4g and honestly.... I have no issues with speed. The phone is pretty fast on T-mobile\\'s network. Of course, I live in a big city. I have no idea what it would be like out in the country. The phone picks up wireless networks and connects to them flawlessly as well. Also, I can create hotspots with the phone. I was excited to find that out cause I connect my tablet to my hot spot at work.The phone has a 13 megapixel camera and it takes very good pictures though not so great in low light. The front-facing camera is great too and I like that you can add effects to the pictures. The stock launcher on it reminds me of the iPhone. It\\'s not bad but I don\\'t care for it so I use Nova Launcher and I customized the phone the way I liked it. I use Nova Launcher on pretty much all Android phones anyway. The phone also has 32GB of space. I downloaded two huge games (FF3 and FF4) from the Playstore and I still got plenty of space left. It handles graphic intensive games pretty well. I noticed no lag while playing FF3. The only issue I\\'ve encountered with the playstore is that The Sims Free Play wasn\\'t compatible with the phone and that\\'s not a big deal for me. However, everything else I play and use has downloaded with absolutely no problems.The sound is very good. The phone is loud and I love that! That was an issue I had with my Nexus 4 - I thought the sound was way too low. I have no trouble hearing people on phone calls and everyone says they can hear me just fine. The sound for the speaker phone is just right in my opinion - not too low, not too loud. I must admit though, holding the phone up to your ear can get uncomfortable due to the corners of the phone.I did have some trouble connecting the bluetooth to my car. For whatever reason, my phone wouldn\\'t detect the bluetooth in my car but then one night while trying, my car\\'s bluetooth suddenly popped up and it connected with no problems. So I\\'m able to stream music through my phone. The music did sound better through my Nexus 4; however, it doesn\\'t sound bad with the BLU Life Pure (just not as good). But I\\'m not really an audiophile so I can\\'t really explain the difference but there is a difference. The music really sounds \"just okay\" vs. \"omfg awesome\" coming through my car speakers via bluetooth. With my Nexus 4, it would show the name of the song across the screen of my radio but not with the BLU Life Pure. I\\'m not sure why but it\\'s not that big of a deal. At least it works. Now, I have been having trouble connecting my JBL speaker to the phone. It seems the Life Pure really sucks at detecting bluetooth connections. But when it does, there is usually no problems with actually connecting it.I\\'ve been told by quite a few people that the phone looks like an iphone. I don\\'t really see that myself but since I\\'ve had two co-workers and my brother tell me that, I guess it must be true. Also, the phone feels lighter than it looks. I was really surprised by how light the phone feels. I know that making phones really light is the trend now but I personally prefer phones that feel a bit heavier. But it\\'s all good.I\\'ve dropped the phone a few times and it still works just fine. No cracks or anything in the screen. So I\\'d say thus far it\\'s pretty durable.I don\\'t know how well the GPS works cause I haven\\'t used it.Other than not being able to download The Sims Free Play, I\\'ve yet to see this phone do something my Nexus 4 couldn\\'t do. I love this phone and BLU has made a believer out of me. I\\'m an average user... things about processors and ram makes no sense to me. I just want to know can my phone connect to the internet? Can I talk and text? Can I take at least decent pictures? Can I connect it to bluetooth? Can I download my favorite games? The answer to all these questions are YES! So the phone gets a 5/5 rating from me! The phone is so cool! I love it! My brother is even considering buying one now. I think this phone is awesome for the price tag that comes with it. When I do decide to upgrade my phone again, I\\'ll definitely be purchasing another BLU phone. No more phones that cost more than my car note! It\\'s heavy and not quite as responsive as some of the Lumia phones my family has. The display doesn\\'t seem quite as good either. The Lumia phones are a better value. It does have dual sim slots though if you need that. The phone is great except the battery isn\\'t very good. Great product! always use an otter box. this one covers the screen as well. is not waterproof.tough and durable. a little bulky, but thats why it works so well. It worked fine until 2 weeks ago, the phone restart itself and doesn\\'t aloud to make an update of the OS. I don\\'t know if is an issue of BLU or of Android. But Either way i would highly recommend TO AVOID BUYING THIS ITEM.And i can\\'t even make a return now because the window for doing that is closed already (how convenient for the seller.) It reboots itself once in a while , while using navigation. I\\'m a Lyft driver. I got this as a gift for my mom. It was a little challenged to get the sim card in at first but after the sim was inserted it worked perfectly. She loves her phone and states that the fact that it flips open is a plus. is okay was a gift for my wife, I like a lot . Works excellent on Cricket. No issues, this is a truly unlocked phone. Had purchased a so called unlocked phone from a retail store that calls it self the Best to Buy at. They even had displayed signs saying \"Free to choose\". Except after paying more then $800 I found out freedom came after paying another $300 over a 6 month period, to Ole Ma-Bell. Then they would provide me an unlock code for my \"unlocked\" phone.If you\\'re looking for a unlocked that\\'s really, buy it here. FYI 2G phone. I bought two of these and had to return because AT&T nolonger supports 2G phones. We emailed plum and verified. They did seem sturdy and well made but was unable to use them so i cannot speak to call quality. i received my package and only the phone shell came NO CHARGER NO BATTERY Perfect for a spare phone. Great service and product. Excelente telefono. Muy Bien Todo Phone has gorrilla glass, fast shipping great deal. Excellent phone. Excellent! I recently ordered this phone in Dec 2014 and I shipped it to a friend who brought it to the Caribbean for me. Firstly, I went to put in a Sim card by my ISP and they told me that the phone was LOCKED and the description by the seller said the phone was UNLOCKED. I was really disappointed as I had to pay over US$20 to get it unlocked. My thing is just be truthful when describing phones. Also the tethering is also blocked and I am still trying to find a way to unblock it.On the flip side, the phone functions well and I love it especially the cam as it takes clean pictures. The phone was also shipped just as it said it would. #Thumbs up to speedy delivery WOW !!! At this price u will nvr find a better phone.. been seven months since using.. nvr a problem.. in this budget, GO for it :) This is a very high quality product which in-person is just as advertised. I was very surprised at the overall look of the book. Images are clear and step-by step is well done. Was a little rocky but at the end good the cell phone came unlocked but i cannot run the internet and the social networks,, additional cannot run the 3g,, the seller has to review the product before sell it,,, cheap and functionally good. Almost 4 months and phone is still working great. very satisfied! received order very fast Everything was good Great product ! Really looked like new ! Am a very happy customer Very good I\\'m very happy with this phone. The button on the side feels a little odd at first but other than that it reminds me of Samsung Galaxy S3 which I loved but couldn\\'t transfer from boost to att. I hate all the go phones from ATT but I like the service . This phone is a great replacement for it and for the price you can\\'t beat that. The android system is really good and customizable. I like that it has two sim slots. I\\'m thinking about getting a second sim for international calls. So far I\\'m liking this phone a lot. If I woukd have stuck with Android this would have been my go to phone, but I went with the 6 Plus. Not because Apple is cooler or makes a better phone, but because of content. Better apps across the board. I create music and Apple has a much more music apps for iOS than android. If it weren\\'t for that, I\\'d be with the Note 4. Cant make the Voice activation work. It came from Samsung-Vietnam.. hard to get warranty help (so far). Very good item, is very functional and has the lastes things for its operation that a cell phone can offer at these days. It seemed like a good phone from what I could tell I just could not use it with the carrier that I have which is TracFone junk Jet Phone wow So small and bulky. I own and love other apple products but not that commited to the cause. I returned it and bough a Samsung galaxy. I wanted a bigger screen. Not sure if my comment still counts. I love this phone, the best phone I ever had so far!!! Buy it you will not regret it trust me! within 2 weeks phone\\'s camera not working, my first experience with Amazon is not good... I am planning to share the same in social media had trouble from the start accessing the internet thought we had it working and quit again. Started having problems with the screen. Returned phone. its a verizon phone , with option to get it partially working with other company SIM.I always get verizon logo with message this is not a verizon SIM.I would\\'t call it unlocked. or put it under this category. good This is my 2nd blu phone and I love this one too!!! I wore the other one out and now here I am, happy with this one too!!! This one is better then ever!!! Whole family has own blu phone\\'s and everyone is very happy also!!! excellent article according to the publication, the purchase is recommended really is very good team and brings all its accessories do not need to purchase protective lining or lamina Son loves his phone , just as well as a higher name brand. No headphones Geat phone! Works Perfectly With METROPCS!! Beautiful Phone!! The watch is OK. Basic, no frills. You are getting what you pay for. Besides needing a extra sim card and a blue tooth head phone this watch works great. The price is great to a lot less then the $ 200.00 that the other guys are asking. Sim-card tray was missing! -.- Perfect size and options for my 78 yr old mom. Really like this phone works perfectly. Only thing is the camera quality isn\\'t the best..... Very good for international use. It was a great device but the sound needs improving. Donnot buy it if you are at USA and with T-mobile service, no 4 G connection This phone is locked,and I\\'m having one hell of a time trying to get it unlocked. I was on the phone with Ting all afternoon yesterday. Also , surprise, it\\'s an AT&T phone . I was not made aware of this until I opened the package. I am returning the phone. I recently purchase this phone from this seller. but it is locked to at&t and shipping package doest not have any acceseries associated with this phone except charger ie not headset, sim ejecting tool, manual, no warranty and nothing.It is used phone. i advice not to buy this item. Very good seller good product and I recommend it 100% to the community, an excellent and functional phone with all operators and very fast and easy handling. regards Horrible will never buy again I\\'ve always bought Nokia phones because of their quality and workmanship. The 6700 slide lacked the workmanship that Nokia is famous for. The slide itself is slightly off and is not a clean fit. This is very disappointing. The materials used are still top notch but that is not an excuse for such poor workmanship. There are also problems with the email software supplied. It is often glitchy and needs to be reset from time to time.These problems aside, I can say that the audio quality is excellent. The best I\\'ve ever experienced in a Nokia. Very clean and crisp and excellent reception even in tunnels. Also battery life is solid and the screen is very good and clear. The camera is ok. Overall it is a barely above average phone. The sound quality is what saves it from being a failure. never came with the sim cards Coudnt fin this phone anywhere but I found it here and it was great!! The price was good and it looked brand new!! Got it for my daughter and she loves the phone. The only thing is, she said the battery looks used! I had Nokia X3 three phones for a year. One stopped working too soon. Second\\'s touch screen isn\\'t working. It is probably a time to get a new model. Muy buen equipo, sus funciones, pantalla, lo recomiendo si les gusta disfrutar de las ventajas de un equipo BB a un precio razonable. Good phone that works as advertised with both sims. The sound is better using the ear buds while on the phone. Speaker could be more powerful. Ability to upgrade storage space is a plus. I particular like that I don\\'t have to carry two phones anymore The phone would not open to the home screen no matter how often i swiped. Altogether i hated it Great phone in great condition. Just want my husband wanted since he doesn\\'t use I phones. Small and compact and fits on his belt. \"Both cell phones with android system problems, one of the boxes and lacked accessories.\"I was really unlucky to receive a product in poor condition and incomplete Great item for friction of price. Work great overseas. Unfortunately the device came defective. I live in Brazil and I can not solve ... was a disappointment for my daughter who was eager for a blackberry Awesome service and went out of way to make sure my purchase was good. The phone is happily being used by the recipent as a gift. As far as I am concerned this is a good phone that works fine with Tracfone as long as you get the tracfone sim card from Wal Mart. Good and light, afgordable. Works great! The product is good 100% and was shipped in the same day and im fine with the service The product is good 100% and was shipped in the same day and im fine with the service. Love it PERFECT! LOVE THE PHONE! Bought this phone twice from same company . First phone was great, but someone stole it from my brother. Second phone didn\\'t work, it was too late to return when I sent it to Jamaica. More than what I expected. Thank you chubbies I like this figo phone but I can\\'t even download the Facebook app. I had it. Went to download another app and couldnt because it says my storage is full. I delete everything out of my phone storage and delete everything off my SD card. Still couldn\\'t not download the app. Deleted the Facebook app and now it is saying my internal storage is too full. Other than the storage it is a good phone. SERIUS RECEPTION PROBLEMS in Temazcal Dr in Santa Monica CA.,Phone calls dropped, the camera quality is way far from the LG 2 cameraWith LG 2, never had this problems This is my first Samsung galaxy phone, and I feel that this experience is great because this phone is the best smartphone on the market right now, therefore I feel happy and excited to have that kind of phone. It is just like new, works great!! I really like this phone. Unfortunately, I could not answer incoming phone calls. Ver y good I bought this s*** two months ago and it doesn\\'t work anymore. Holy s***! muy bien Cool very cool to have This is the second one I have bought and they both broke. This time the clip broke off the very next day. I love it. The phone works and looks great thus far (one day) and the seller, Onestopshoppe. was great. excellent! It sucked Very happy with my purchase, price, shipping and arrival time! Very fast delivery. My 1st LG phone and It\\'s simply just AWESOME Love my new phone. I was sketchy in the beginning about it being an international phone.... But it works GREAT! The phone came with a US adapter for the charger. I\\'m buying another J7 for my husband next. Definitely recommend this phone! Bad things- Short battery life.Bad service connection.Nobody can hear me unless I plug in the earphones.Cannot lable notes in the note taking feature.Good things- talk text.... Excelente Works great will do business again DONT BUY IT!!!I bought 2 and had problems with both of them.Battery of both lasts only 4 hours. And in one of them i cant use 2g, 3g nor 4g when its supposed to work.(Im frrm Argentina). Looks like new works like new. Doesn\\'t looks like refurbished.delivered with original case and charger. Best deal I would ever get on an apple watch I like it Thanks , my Phone work very well in Venezuela Too Slow A great phone for the price. The camera is nice because now I can download my pictures on to my computer, which I could not do with my old phone. llego en buen estado y completo funciona a la perfeccion todavia lo estoyusando realmente compre lo que queria gracias The best phone ever made I switched to this from a galaxy s4 because I wanted a durable android phone usable with one hand - imho they are making them way too big now days.Very satisfied with this phone. As someone who uses their phone for calls, email, texts, and music, its tech specs are more than adequate. It even plays the newer games very smoothly though that\\'s less important. Also the fact that it\\'s water proof is a major plus on my long bike rides.4g lte speeds are also much, much faster than they were on my s4. The screen, although smaller, is brilliant and sharp because the pixels are so densely packed. The screen looks and feels just like the original iphone 4 screen. That is, it looks like a retina display, can\\'t see any pixels (and I have 20/10 vision).All things considered, however, I would have liked a better quality camera - a lot of the low-light photos come out very grainy, and the mountain-panorama shots I take while on rides don\\'t have the resolution I would like. All told though I can\\'t complain, much better than the S4 Excellent Returned phone. I have had Iphones, and liked them, but this windows phone is the best I have ever encountered. The operating system works flawlessly, thousands of good practical and entertaining apps are available for any interest or need...and call quality is excellent.battery life could be longer, but I do spend an inordinate amount of time reading on mine so.... There are now 5 of these phones in my house. I\\'ve had mine since 2011 and it has been dropped hundreds of times from Minnesota to Afghanistan and it hasn\\'t died yet. I\\'m talking about the kind of drops that shoot the battery 10 feet in one direction and the phone in the other. I really like this phone because I just want a sturdy phone that can send texts. A phone for making phone calls. And texting. And nothing else. Okay, I keep some calendar events in there too but mainly I make calls and send texts and, whenever I drop it, it keeps working--going on 6 years now. Also, my 4 kids all have the same model because I swear that those animals could break an anvil so I got them this tank of a phone so I don\\'t have to replace their phones every 5 minutes. The kids don\\'t have data plans nor are they getting one anytime soon. All they need are phones that make phone calls and send texts so their mom can know their every movement. It\\'s like she\\'s tagged some bears and is tracking their migration (at the lowest possible cost). And none of the kids have broken their phones either. How long have the kids had them? A total of nearly 8 years between them. Add that to my 6 years of ownership and we have 5 LG Octanes with almost 14 years of total usage with no defects thus far. I hope I can find another one if mine finally kicks the bucket. I like this phone. A quality phone at an OK price. I\\'ve had this watch for a few days now. It synced to my android just fine. Downloaded the app for phone with the qr code. Fit is comfortable. I have small wrists and it isn\\'t so huge it bothers me, don\\'t notice it really. All notifications work well. When I get a notification it plays my phone ringtone, so both this and my phone are babbling minions till I check it. The sleep monitor works fine. Only tried that once so idk how true but for last night being as I didn\\'t sleep it said poor, seems right. The pedometer works well but is a little slow. Takes a few to catch up. Texts messages come threw fine and you can reply to them. Phone calls come threw but i have not been able to talk on it due to interference with something else in my home (possibly other Bluetooth devices interfering). Browser, remote capture, image viewer and audio player I cannot get to function. I\\'ve sent an email to the company due to this not really having instructions. There was some but didn\\'t have much info. So overall this is a good starter watch for someone wanting to try a smart watch, which is why I bought it. It works ok for the price. (Will add more on email reply from company) I\\'m still getting used to it but I have to say, it is a very nice device. Good 💯 Good I was extreamly skeptical about buying a used iphone that i could not even see what it looked like, the description said it was in good condition and came with a case and charger. I received my phone 5-6 days before the scheduled delivery date, when i opened the package it made me very weary about it being in a envelope. I was pleased to see that the phone had absolutely no scratches or cracks, when i turned it on it worked perfect! My phone looks brand new and you would never know it was used! I am one happy customer, i haven\\'t activated it yet but if i have a problem i will be sending it back, but im sure i wont! Defiantly recommend buying one, you will not be let down! One of the 2 phones come with failure wifi. Love this phone can not complain The 2 sim chips work fine for me, the only issue if you could call it like that is that there is so few or none custom roms for the cellphone.IF what you want is a phone to use 2 sims then this phone could be the right for you I had this phone for 6 months I had the Samsung Galaxy 4 note but they are virtually the same thing without the note I\\'ve dropped it a few times and it didn\\'t break so it\\'s definitely durable AWESOMEEEE Excellent phone for the value. Returned it. Basic call text worked and some app notifications. Had issue with it resetting the location to a city in south America which would change my time. Also didn\\'t like that all sounds from phone went to the watch so media that I had muted blasted from its speaker unintentionally. Ended up with refurbished Gear 2 and I\\'m happy. When I read the description, it stated that the phone would have light, minimal scratched on the screen. The front and back screen were in great condition, however, there were many more issues. The battery was toast, and shut the phone off at 20%. The metal frame is bent at the top of the phone, making it hard to use a case. The flash doesn\\'t work. The camera has dark spots, the charger that came with the phone doesn\\'t work. The speaker is blown, and people can\\'t hear me. I contacted the seller, and the response was quick, but it was as useful as not contacting them at all. They offered to repair everything minus the metal frame, but I\\'d have to send the phone back on my dollar, and be stuck without a phone until they sent it back. Nothing else. Of course, I didn\\'t send it back. Be very cautious when buying. This is an edit to an earlier review I made. Another consumer (I think) pointed out that it uses a different network than Verizon and that I should have done my research. Well, maybe I should have. But I don\\'t know, I\\'m a consumer, and even though I agree that consumers should indeed do their homework, the majority will read \"Super Cool Quad Band Watch\". And since there is no disclaimer in the specifications, most would probably buy it. I mean I\\'m not an expert, but how many people really know what GSM or CMDA means? If the Verizon guy couldn\\'t figure it out......Anyway, I bought this product, took it to my cell phone carrier (Verizon) and they could not get it to work. Because I am not willing or able to search all of the cell phone carriers to find out which one can get it to work, and because of the fact that it is way more bulkier than I thought, I returned it.You know what, in all fairness, I\\'ll upgrade my rating because I can\\'t speak on how it works. But I got a white one and the watch band is a noticeable different shade of white compared to the watch. If you are getting it for your kid like I did, just know that it is bulky and looks like someone grabbed a nokia and trimmed off the key pad and slapped it onto a wristband. JUST MY OPINION. Again, It might work for you but the look threw me off. this phone advertised incorrect information. this phone does NOT have 4G lte capability (at least with At&t). I ordered this phone for a family member therefore didnot find out until i played with it recently. not cool man. My iPhone that I ordered from Amazon worked great. I had no issues with turning it on or getting it activated. Came unscathed with charging equipment. I am highly satisfied and love my phone! Great phone fast delivery. its okay to used but you cant used any and every headpiece on it, it also freeze now and then. plenty tough but a little slipperier than I would like due to the hard plastic case. I bought another brand for my next phone that was 1/4 the cost and I like it better. is not working properly, is turn off when i using, i think is the battery, i pay for a new telephone and i think is not The phone arrived quickly. It was in original packaging, which was, however, opened to include a simple travel adapter to convert the European plug on the cord to American one for US wall sockets. The packaging was carefully closed again with a similar piece of tape, which of course caused some alarm that there was some foul play. No worries, it was just the plug.The phone has a dual slot for the regular sized SIM cards (the so-called mini-sim or 2FF). I have had the phone now a few weeks and it works like a dream. I only needed it as a secondary phone to my heavy duty Samsung Galaxy S 2 Plus and have only installed and used a limited array of applications. I have not had any performance issues with apps or otherwise. I have two European SIM cards in it - for business purposes. Both cards connect very happily sometimes with AT&T and sometimes with T-Mobile. In my relatively modest daily use the battery lasts for about three full days before it needs to be recharged. The only, very mild complaint I can make is that Samsung has introduced a strong contrast to the screen colours of this model. Yes, it makes colours brighter - the ones you can see, but it loses some of the colours in exchange. It is the same problem as with glossy TVs and computer screens. Everything looks bright and shiny, but image quality suffers. As I said, this is a very minor issue - on a phone. I would say that for the price I paid, this phone is truly worth every penny. Has performed flawlessly so far. Nice bright screen and unlike my last phone have been able to install all the apps I want. Great phone!!! Love Love Love!!!! I ordered this phone and had to send it out-of-state to my son for whom I had ordered it. It was great until it needed charged and then it wouldn\\'t take the charge. He took it to a Verizon store, but it just would not charge. I contacted the company and they are replacing it!! Great looking stand!This was a great buy and highly recommend it. I use nightstand app now for my alarm clock and lay my phone horizontal instead of vertical shown in the picture. watch stays stationary now too. very convenient product I bought this for my 13 and 16 year old sons and they absolutely love it! Great cell for reasonable price! No regrets buying it! I would recommend this product! BLU is awesome! Great phone. Would luv to review future phones from them. Went in this one with mixed feeling. Am very pleased with it. Doesn\\'t feel like a low end phone. Durable and all functions work well. Fast loading and large BEAUTIFUL SCREEN. I am PLEASANTLY surprised. I have a new cell phone company in my life for the future. Luv u BLU! I ordered one of these in red. Expected case for phone to be red also. When I opened it the case is pink and white. It is a gift for my son. And I cannot find a case for this phone anywhere!!! Very frustrated!!! Good No need to buy the expensive brands this phone has it all Really good phone. Works good with bluetooth. works great i got the wrong order Kargia It is a good choice for adult people who hates the touch screen in smartphones good product.....like it very much. Ver good The blackberry that I bought was not new it was used but the advertisenent in amazon said it was new.The battery drained so fast I will omly gave one star. Bought this to use in the US on Metropcs/T-Mobile. It worked perfectly. Great features for a \"low budget\" phone. It had some software problems when I got it, like it was really unstable, but then I updated the software and it was just fine. Then the GPS stopped working and I could no longer navigate outside my zip code. Then the frame started peeling. Here I was thinking it was metal or something but it looks like it\\'s just shiny metal paint. Once it starts peeling in one area, there\\'s no stopping the spread. Even with the case on it\\'s still peeling. Little tiny chips come off everytime I remove the case, and I can\\'t not remove the case because I hate grimy phones, and I change cases very often. Great for the money! Very fast, good battery and acceptable camera. The cellphone works fine here in Venezuela BUT, the box where it came was a used one, The phone came from some country that use \"Claro\"... Looks good but i paid for a new one not used! Great deal! i got an amazon gift card when i did my taxes...that was my first mistake. once i got the card, i had to spend it...i looked at phones and ordered a cheap iphone...but after i month i realised it was not coming...i have asked for my money back... All was perfect Great upgrade from a Samsung Galaxy S2. I hate big cellphones so this S5 mini was my best choice. I\\'ve been using it for a couple months and I can\\'t complain. wrong size Fast shipper and responds quick! BUEN GRACIAS had it for a few days now. faster than my nexus 7 2013 according to antutu!! not only that but better camera both rear and front and plus the phone functionality I feel like I\\'m carrying a powerhouse with me in such a small,slim, beautiful phone! might update more in the future. Battery life is amazing, that is the main reason I bought this phone. But, if you try to multitask, the phone will have bugs. I was on the phone while trying to email and take photos and it would bug out. So if you need a phone for basic use, with excellent battery life and pretty look, of course large screen...you could be satisfied. Once again 2 stars less for a lot of bugs since I am multitasking. Nice phone but can not get it to connect to the net. best of the 6 in the smaller body! Excellent Product!! All what I expected. Well I got it when It was on sale, so for the price it was an affordable upgrade from a garbage nokia lumia 521. My only qualm is that it is extremely slow/unresponsive while charging. I can\\'t seem to find a fix. good quality This is my second Windows phone, and I\\'m very happy with the quality and experience of this phone. The pictures are excellent. No need to buy the expensive brands. When trying to order an iPhone 5 I was specifically looking for the cdma Verizon version. The seller was very clear in his description and it was exactly what I was looking for. The phone was brand new, in the package still wrapped with all accessories as expected. The seller also provided the MEID of the phone upon placing an order as to confirm that it was a clean esn. This also allowed me to check if the phone was compatible for straight talk in my area and it was. When I paid the extra couple dollars for expedited shipping it was upgraded to 2 day priority mail. I placed my order on Wednesday and received my order the following Friday. Couldn\\'t ask for any more. It was just what I wanted and was actually cheaper than they said it would be. It was a couple of days later than I thought it would be. Goog Great phone, awesome camera ...you can take advantage of it with and app like camera FV5 and cinema FV5. The one which could have been great to have in my country was the A2003 due to radio frequencies specially 4G-LTE still works good enough for me. Just make sure you can get the one meeting your provider specs. The phone has many glitches!! I order the samsung s6 after switching from samsung s5 duos to ip6s+. The pucture quality of ip6s+ and the apps which need ma(p were linked to apple map) were so bad. I already gave my s5 away so s6 duos is better replacement. After turning it on and transferring the data from s5, I can have my old apps/note/sms. The display od s6 is so nice. Quality of the picture is also nice. The only thing on my wish list is the micro sd slot. I hope it will come back in s7 This is the first smart phone I\\'ve owned, just getting out of the dinosaur age! It\\'s pretty easy to navigate through what I need to do on it. We purchased two of these, and so far have been great. We need to go through the tutorial someday to get the full benefits of the phone. Great communication! Exactly as stated. I\\'m happy. Item did not meet my need, the item was defective when it said it was supose to be working fine. Their hard to comunicate with, i would not buy from them again. Traveled to the Caribbean with this phone it worked great.Great buy and quality no issues .Highly recommend. exactly as described. super fast shipping. Awesome This is an awesome phone for the price. The phone has decent memory without SD card inserted. Takes nice pictures. Sound is good. The home buttons glitch every now and then but that isn\\'t too bad. The build is in the good quality range, it\\'s well built. Since we received the phone is been worth the money and time spent on it This product is bad and very defective, the phone stopped working after 3months of use and it was supposed to be a new phone,the screen went blank rendering it inoperable and no return policy ,so what do I do with the phone now? excellent. First of all the phone was advertised as a metro pcs phone but when i received it, it turned out to be a criket phone.False advertisement. Second the phone was delivered without a phone battery or the back of the phone. i contacted seller and they said nothing was able to be done, and that i could not return it. god Excelent! excellent! it works perfectly fine and is exactly what we reed on the descrption. thanks for your honesty. Is in the best conditions. The deliver was on time. Nothing bad to say. Thank you very much. EXCELENTE I ordered this since it is mentioned Unlocked. I ordered this to use outside US. Unfortunately 3G is not supported there so I\\'m stuck with this phone only having EDGE. My recommendation is, if anyone intention to use this outside US please check that country 3G bands and make sure it is matching with the one mentioned in this phone. (4G HSPA+ up to 21Mbps 850/1700/1900) So I\\'ve no use this phone now and can\\'t be returned also. The phone shipped fast amd the free month of service was great! Thank you! Had a different Boulder and it didn\\'t work well. So got this one and everything works well. I am very happy with the purchase. Happy with the phone. Excellent product Great buy. Excellent phone, amazing camera and works perfect 4G with Movilnet and Movistar in Venezuela ... Don\\'t doubt to buy this phone and arrived very quickly Great start up phone with good specs and screen size. BLU is highly recommended for a teen\\'s first phone. Too big Just got my IPhone 5C. Got it in 4 days. No problem. Everything worked out great. Would have been nice if the price was cheaper. But My recommendation is to spend that extra money and get a new one, I don\\'t trust the old ones.The only con with this purchase was the headphones are crap and knock off. Didn\\'t even work properly. The phone charger/adapter also is not apple. But I already have plenty of those so it didn\\'t matter. That is the only reason why I didn\\'t given 5/5 stars. Overall very satisfied Good phone, but not satisfy with the camera. Good value for price and performance. Apart from the way out right position of the back key, the unit well worth it. Just be sure to buy a decent sized memory card. Caution when purchasing this phone. Not Bluetooth compatible (at least with my previously compatible S4), no GPS. Written on the box European Sim Only. The phone has a nice screen and probably a better processor other than that is not that much better than the S4 but considerable bigger than a mini should be. I want a mini to be mini. Unfortunate I\\'m a gadget person and wanted this unit for a long time now. I\\'m a little disappointed. Well, back to the S4 I go. im quite disappointed to say i order a new phone and it look like a refurbish phone, the battery cover look like it not for the phone, a see part of the side phone done getting away, i had used a pearl 8100 and a 8320 and when loading i see blackberry or o2 but this one i seeing some kind of mtn not sure anyone have this problem with it, and the pre loaded theme not like i know of other bb phone and next time when pass had on the screen feeling all the edge plus it screen didnot come with a plastic covering like i know all new phone come with.plus i have a problem not the phone not reading the memory card, sometime ago i check on the inside and i really look used the pin that inside back of phone not corresponding with with phone actually used, it look like a waste of money so i vex. I love it. I dont think this phone is realy 3g because i had a 3g before this one and it picked up fine but this one does not pick up as good. But on the other hand it is a good phone It is perfect... Love this case! I know my phone will be protected and really like the colors! Great phone. Bought as gift for a friend in Venezuela, I went there, gave it to her and a few days later I came back... and she started having problems with the phone... battery drained fast, purchased another brand new original battery, same problem, phone started to restart itself every moment. Because I am an electronics tech and had business over there repairing cell phones for more than 6 years, I advised her to take it to a friend\\'s repair facility and just insert the diagnostic tester device, to speak simple. Phone had a problem that involved the internal power supply and the ESN micro chip. She sent it back to the states, paid for the shipping, and when I tried to contact the company that sold it, they never answer. Money waisted, and lost. The phone went to the trash bin. NOT ORIGINAL DO NOT GET IT Phone is great no problems with that. Sims card is the problem and sprint is the biggest problem on getting one. Not the phone guys problem but sprint is just a pain to deal with period. finally after 2 weeks of fighting with sprint they are sending me a new sims card. I had no problems with the seller. It worked for my Kitty Wireless cellular service! Bought BB 9900 but received BB 9930 but love the phone Wow! Two phone numbers (two sim cards) on one small phone! Everything about this phone is outstanding. I am very happy and content with my first I phone. A friend recommodated to me and it\\'s above my expertations.So know enjoy Evert day the bennefits of this product. The only thing that im worry about its that the cel trends to overheat too fast... just with two minutes of continuous use! but, to be fair, its not that hot. This phone has a nice facial design but its carbage. Please do not invest Ur hard money in this s***. 1) no perminent signal. You won\\'t get signal if u driving no receive calls. I downloaded a apps to boost signal but Nada. Can\\'t connect to home wifi which is 3ft away from phone and when I get 2 connected internet. Takes all year to go online. This is phone is trash. Don\\'t throw Ur money away. Greatly designed phone.Fast, beautiful, elegant phoneStereo speakers made the phone to work nicer than any other one in the market in terms of playing videos and music using the built-in speakers.Excellent sound using the headphones (I have Beats headphones) and they sound really similar to them. Difference is not noticeable. (Maybe there are \"hidden\" Beats, who knows)One thing you should knowi is that it comes with Android 4.4.2 and this OS has a restriction using the Memory card (MMC) this is a Google thing not the phone\\'s, so that is why I did not lower the rating. Passing files to the memory card from the internal memory is not allowed unless the application installed has permissions to write to the MMC. I had to root the phone and modify the permissions to remove this restriction. good phone, need more time to grasp features. The Sony compact series has always been my go to for an Android phone because of the size and speed. The previous compacts were based on the latest and greatest highest end chip set at the time of their releases. When this phone was announced as having the SD 650, I was more than disappointed so I wrote the phone off. I wasn\\'t sure which phone to get so I bought an iPhone 7 which lasted a couple weeks until I remembered how restricted ios was. I then had three options for a smallish phone. The Honor 8.. Still a little large, the Google pixel.. Expensive! and the Sony X compact. I had all three within about a month. I kept the X compact. Yep that\\'s right. I gave up the greatest from Google and a very premium made Honor 8. The reason?Number 1-the feel and size are just right. Its just a joy to use and carry.Number 2- i immediately realized that this phone is just as fast as the z5 compact and I\\'m not sure what they did but this phone is silky smooth, almost iphone like. You have some hang ups like every other Android like in the play Store but overall I am really impressed with the performance. That just shows that specs are not everything and there is something to be said for real optimization.Number - 3 price. It was dropped to $399 when I bought mine. Compared to the pixel, it\\'s half the price.I\\'m no Camara guru so I can\\'t really speak on this too much but it does take some real nice shots in good light. Low light will not be the best.Many people are bashing because the phone isn\\'t waterproof but it doesn\\'t bother me.*edit. It\\'s frustrating when someone gives one star and is not even talking about this phone!! The X compact does NOT have a cover for the USB!!!! This proves that the reviewer is ignorant. Amazon needs to monitor these reviews better!! LED screen went out after three weeks of use. Excellent seller and products and very nice battery doesn\\'t stand long even when mobile is not in use..... did not get earpiece with the phone i love the phone but was disappointed that i didn\\'t receive earphones with phone Everything was ok :) wife likes it I had the iphone 6 before, i decided to upgrade to the 6s plus. Im happy i purchased it and i cant see myself going back to the 4.7 inch iphone anymore. The 5.5 inch screen is perfect for my needs. It took sometime getting used to the bigger size, but i adapted to it quickly. The charger does not work Great seller took back quickly. Phone like many won\\'t work it\\'s a version problem Always buy things from amazon directly, they are responsable and everything always arrive fast and just like you ordered, excellent cell phone, the only down is the camera wich has no good resolution and no flash, but the rest ist OK I bought the phone because the seller said it was unlocked, then I went to a store to buy a sim card, they said the phone is locked, its asking for a pin code it was not provided also I was not advided from the seller the phone did not come with the charger. I am not satisfied and I am returning the item. Nice i like This phone has never worked rite from the start. It freezes up and will barely run on the internet. I was wonderin if yall would be willin to fix it. Id pay a teasonable price to have it fixed I purchased this phone as an upgrade to my BlackBerry Passport. The phone is made very well and feels like a quality product including the nostalgic QWERTY keyboard.If you plan on using this phone and tie it into your BlackBerry server the BB interface is on par with the previous BB Hub in BB10.Unfortunately my company decided to no longer support BB once the last BB OS phone dies and I had to move to Good.I had very high expectations of this phone from BlackBerry merging their security, features with the Android OS and app availability.The OS does what every Android phone does but I noticed bugs quite frequent. The lack of a fingerprint scanner is annoying if you use Good instead of BES12 or use other applications that will require a second sign in. I preferred to use the on screen keyboard most of the time as typing is much faster. I attempted to use the keyboard for scrolling and keep away from smudges and fingerprints but the screen response to keyboard swipes is very jerky and not fluid at all. Don\\'t buy TODO PERFECTAMENTE BIEN.. RECOMENDADO 100% Samsung has one of the worst customer service I have dealt with. Have had the Galaxy S7 for less than a year and started crapping out on me by slowing down and constantly closing down programs. Talked with the customer service which was rude and apathetic. Sent in the phone to their repair center in a Plano Texas. Apparently it was a battery issue and they \"repaired\" it. They sent back phone and I received it completely damaged. The screen was completely inked out. They initially wanted to blame UPS but there was no apparent damage to the box or packaging. They finally owned up to the damage but was completely unhelpful with going about resolving the issue. They had the audacity to say normally I would be charged to fix the screen THEY damaged. I am completely done with Samsung and all their products that apparently either malfunctioning or blowing up. If you need a simple phone for talking and texting, this id the phone for you! It also takes decent pictures. When my first Nokia C3 finally died, I went on a search for another one because I loved it so much. You can\\'t find better battery life. It\\'s simple to use. I don\\'t need all of the fancy stuff, so it\\'s perfect for me. Very user friendly! On the occasion of the testimony of my short experience with this phone, in order to serve someone else and if it is possible that the manufacturer improve its products, I make this review.Pros:The phone is fairly light weightGood appearanceQWERTY very pleasant to operate, good size keys that reduces any possibility of error by typingThe appearance and form are very strikingMessages and phone calls very solid, no noiseCons:The operating system is relatively poor. For example, I included music by OVI and after a while I wanted to remove, it was practically impossible without leaving a trace on the phone. In various parts of your rankings are the same song, which does not seem bad to me, however, when you delete a song or albums are traces of the deleted song impossible to remove pointing errors. Even restoring the track to choose another way to delete does not mean that it ceases to occur. OVI software and the phone in this regard is poor. I have chosen to avoid including applications, songs, etc. than the original settings, trying to avoid filling up your mistakes erased. Compare this procedure to include and delete songs from your computer using iTunes or from my iPod touch directly.Thanks. Amazing!!! Phone last long, and have great battery life. Have always loved Nokia phones and this one is no exception, as long as it makes calls I\\'m fine Worked perfectly right out the box. No problems. As described by seller. broke in the 1st week I\\'ve had the Blu Energy X for two weeks now. I have to say it\\'s not the best Blu phone I have had, but it\\'s got its perks.Pros:~Good battery. Not the best (I miss my Studio Energy, wanted the Studio Energy 2 but out of my budget) but it gets me from sunup to sundown.~Android 5.1. Amazing. Great features.~Seems to me that I can store more apps on my SD card versus other Android phones I\\'ve owned.Cons:~VERY glitchy. I\\'ve had to restart the phone several times because apps would crash and not open.~It took about seven times to download certain apps.~1 GB RAM is really not enough to run everything I want.~Phone is slow to call. I hit call button and it takes several seconds to show that it made the call. Also the phone rings for 5-8 seconds before the screen pops up to let me answer.I\\'ll be keeping this phone, but as soon as I can I\\'ll be getting the Studio Energy 2. good AfternoonThe reason I write it is that on Monday I received here in Venezuela the requested product, the problem is that when you open and use the sensor Jostick or middle ball is damaged or does not move one way or another and not to want to serve I would like to know that solution can give the product as the request indicated that it was me again and I came with this defect.regardsjohn king Came as claimed. Near flawless condition... I couldn\\'t find anything wrong with it if I tried. Only thing is it came with a black back piece of aluminum... No apple logo or and writing, at all. But it grew on me its very sleek. Phone operates as expected and is lightning fast. I would suggest to anyone. It\\'s better than what I was expecting I love it. Great job Nokia and Microsoft. !!!!!!!! Freezes alot. best iPhone yet I got this phone 2 days ago and its alright, i only say that because i hate blackberrys and its my first one & i downgraded from an iPhone to this. So the contrast is hard for me. This phone is running on 4.6 and i tried everything possible to bring it up to OS 5 and i cant. It tells me its up to date ughhh, is anyone else having this issue? Great cellphone great condition perfect cellphone everything is working fine it\\'s been a long time since I have a great condition cellphone It is an uncomplicated cell phone that will fit in a pocket very nicely. I love the simplicity and it meets my daily cell phone requirments. The item description said \"New\" if that was the case then the piece at the top of the phone would not be coming off. If I wanted a used phone I would have bought one. Will not be ordering from this company in the future. Disappointed. When I opened the BB cell phone in the back inside part it had sulphate in several places. I have used it and it seems to work ok but why did it have sulphate inside ? I think it was not new and I had ordered a new cell phone. Comes locked to AT&T. Thankfully, it\\'s super easy to unlock a legit model number on AT&T\\'s website and it works great. This phone is great. I have been using is for 3 mths now.It is unlocked as described and all you need to do is provide the sim card. It works very well and it is fast. It can play most games and other applications. I like that it has a lot of space As i download a lot of stuff.I have rather big hands and the keyboard on the screen is big enough to accommodate my fingers without making too many mistakes. The screen being big is also a good thing since it makes things such as text easier to see so you can do other things such as reading a book for example.The 8 mp camera takes great clear photos and the video isn\\'t bad either.It comes with Android Gingerbread (v 2.3) but with the Samsung Keis software you can easily upgrade the phone to Jellybean (v 4.1.2)What I don\\'t like about this phone is the the battery life is VERY poor. Satisfied Perfect fit. Quick delivery. I received this damaged. It didn\\'t turn on or charged and I couldn\\'t even return it because I am in Ecuador. Such a waste of money. Really impressed with the quality of the phone; very easy to set up and add a plan. I would definitely recommend this retailer to anyone interested in purchasing a phone from the retailer and will definitely purchase my next one from them. Thanks! The phone looks brand new!! No scratches or scuffs. My son loved it and there was no problem with the activation. excelente Bought this for my father and in less than a month it stopped working out of the blue. Is the second BLU phone he has owned that has stopped working, I don\\'t recommend this brand to anyone. Don\\'t waste your money. I love this phone This is an awesome phone if you are using a no-contract service like Net-10 or Straight Talk. Not the best, but definitely competitive against other big brand phones for this price. Do you need the best? Probably not. Get this instead. Very nice phone. I also bought sandisk 200gb and it works great. Great condition. Exactly as described. I ordered this phone from the seller above in July and received it promptly (before the weekend hit, though it was expected to arrive on Monday. Awesome!) and in great condition. The phone had no scratches or dents & worked flawlessly.But months later in November the phone simply stopped working. It randomly cut off and hasn\\'t come back on.Mind you this isn\\'t the seller\\'s fault but be very aware of the common issues this phone can have! I loved it, but very disappointed to have it die after a few months of regular usage. It also died a month after HTC\\'s warranty ran out, so it appears getting a new model is my only option. I have the Samsung Galaxy NOTE 10.1. This case fits PERFECTLY. It protects my tablet all around. A must have!!With the tablet in place, The MAIN CASE ITSELF measures 7 1/2\" from top to bottom by 10 1/2\" from side to side.When fully covered (2-pc case), it measures 11\" length x 8\" width.It is specifically made for the 10.1\" N8000 Samsung Galaxy NOTE phone/tablet with stylus. It is an awesome case offering great protection for this tablet.(But if you have anything other than the NOTE Tablet I just described, do NOT get, it will not fit.)Love love love ***** I love these phones. I have even turned my husband on the the brand. It is a great phone for the price. The phone look like a new phone. Been using it for almost a month and no problem. the camera is bad. :/ excellent product excelente Very good value for the price. This phone simple to understand and great to use All good! Works okay for a gift. Garbage did not last long Verry. Good👍 This phone is a starter phone those who are not used to smart phones. Very flimsy and slow. Not the phone for tech savvy people. Thanks J&R. Good service, phone works, my son has no problem with it. I had a expectations very low for this, but for 50 dollars, its good. I liked that comes with case and screen protector ... Only, I found something big, I thought it was smaller This used phone came not being able to read the sim card!!!! i call this Fraud!! it is wrong!! i want my $60 back its not right Great phone with 2 issues, GPS does not lock in to location, battery life is not good. I\\'m really happy I chose this phone instead of the galaxy s5.I used to have a galaxy s4 and now that I have this one I can really appreciate the difference when holding the phone: this one feels sturdy and made of quality materials, unlike the plastic feeling you get when holding most other phones.The interface is simple and elegant, without the extra apps that Samsung puts as part of their OS, making Android run very smoothly. The only thing I miss from my old s4 is the option of swiping over a contact to make a phone call or send a message directly, but otherwise I would pick this cleaner Android version over Samsung\\'s every time.The camera is not the best. It takes nice low light pictures (a lot better than the s4) but otherwise the colors are just not as bright and pictures don\\'t have as much detail (4 \"ultrapixels\" is just not enough). If you care a lot about taking pictures with your phone and cropping them afterwards, this is not the phone for you.If you are not into taking photos, but care a lot about having a durable and nice looking phone, running Android smoothly without the overloaded, kind of clunky interface of the galaxy sX (heart rate monitor... really??), this is definitely the phone for you and I can guarantee you will never even notice the \"missing\" features when comparing it to the s5. Excellent Was a brand new card but it wasn\\'t for my phone Great phone!!. Great service from the seller. Nice phone, great value, I was looking for an iphone, but didnt want to pay $300 or $400 for a newer version, so I went with this 3gs. It arrived in like new condition with all the features of the iphone for a much more affordable price. great This has been the smoothest phone I have ever had. It really only lags when I end up not paying attention to how many tabs I have open in Chrome (really man, 24 tabs, you can close a few of those). Otherwise it runs like a champ has an all day battery and with the Marshmallow update, it is just getting better. This phone is very nice.It has a nice 5 inch screen and is pretty slim and light. The speed is also very good for the price paid, reminds me of an S3. The cameras work good, and the wife is great, I was able to skype with no issues.It comes in a very nice giftable box, and really looks like its worth a lot more then the $140 I paid.I use it on AT&T, and it worked out of the box with no issues. It took about 5 minutes to download all my apps and start chatting on whatsapp. I am really liking this phone. I read some reviews where people did not think the screen is bright enough but it is alright with me. It is difficult to see in bright sunlight. The speaker is not the best for listening to music but I do enjoy listening to radio stations. If I want to listen to music for an extended period I use my earbuds anyway. I especially like the dual active SIM. I probably won\\'t use that capability often but it is nice to have it. For the price I really don\\'t know what else you could expect. 4 gigabytes of RAM with 64 gigabytes of storage unlocked for $300. Case fits very nicely..complete phone coverage...the most sturdy casing material I have ever felt or seen. Looking forward to putting this through the paces. It sucks worse phone I\\'ve ever had, froze every time I got a phone call and is only a 2g, didn\\'t realize how old is was till I got it Splendid item. It met my expectation. The cell works well, however for some reason the charging is a problem. I have to charge while cell is off and it doesn\\'t always work. I have to turn cell off and on several times before it will actually charge. I don\\'t recommend this cell, their are so many more better cells than this one. Keep shopping. This phone sucks and It wnt let me use it with out wifi and wnt let me send pic messages and have done everything they told me to do and still is not working at all and would like another phone or something Good quality, Good price. Working good.. Does everything I want a cell phone to do and it came Packaged in original box and looked like it was never used. Great phone! If you\\'re looking for a great budget friendly phone, can\\'t go wrong here! Great build quality and features. However once I updated to Android M, I lost some key features such as Motorola assist. :( boo! Works like a champ. Exactly the way I wanted it. I recently bought an iPhone 4S from this seller. When it arrived it looked fine. We went to Verizon to set it up- and here is where the problem started. The camera light would not turn off, the tech said that\\'s a sign of water damage and it was literally draining the battery at very rapid rate. I booked a Genius Bar appointment at apple to see if it could be fixed. When they opened up the phone they discovered it has been tampered with, voiding the warranty and the light was not repairable.Contacted the seller who sent us another iPhone 4S. POTENTIAL BUYERS READ THIS: given our issue with the last phone we booked another apple store appointment just to have the phone checked out. It\\'s even worse this time around, the apple tech said it had been tampered with and cautioned us to get rid of the phone as soon as possible. When I pushed him for details on what was wrong with the phone, He said the phone had been tampered with to the point that it can be used for IDENTITY THEFT, basically opening any accounts used on the phone and getting account information- he wasn\\'t supposed to tell us this but thank god he did! Almost everyone I know has a banking app or email with very private information.No matter how much it ends up costing you, do not buy from this seller. I\\'m fairly certain all of the positive reviews are from people who are none the wiser and never had their phones inspected by an apple tech. Remember that it takes over a year to get your identity back if its stolen, not worth it for a used iPhone. Excelente equipo, lo recomiendo a quienes desean tener un buen equipo por mucho tiempo, es lo mejor que BB ha tirado al mercado. My sole purpose of this purchase was to use this phone as a small form factor android media player that I can listen to Spotify music thru blue-tooth headphones while I am in the gym or running. With this setup I am completely satisfied with the size and operation of this device.Pros-1) Small Form factor2) Runs on Andriod3) Price4) Battery Life5) Prompt Tech-supportCons-1) I received a non-English version of the phone. The firmware had to be flashed with an English version. Tech-support sent out how-to instructions along with links for the firmware, drivers, and installation tool. It took several tries but I was finally able to flash the phone to English. Bear that in mind if you decide to get the phone and come up with my situation.2) Small Keyboard - I dread having to type anything on this phone.3) Special Micro USB charging cable - This cable has a longer male jack. Due to the way the phone jack is designed, a regular micro USB cable is too short to fully insert in so it will not charge. You will have to use the provided USB cable that came with it which is annoying because it is extra gear you need to take with you Bought this phone in August 2014, December 2014 the charge port quit working and by March 2015 the microphones failed as well. I like the look of the phone and the software is great for the price. The main thing is read the fine print if you plan on buying the phone and having it repaired by BLU warranty service. You have to send your phone to them in Miami and wait forever to hear anything back from their customer service. They claim repairs only take 10-15 days, but it has been over a month since I sent my phone to them and still have not got it back....My point is whether you buy this device or any BLU device be prepared for poor customer service when it has issues. It\\'s not the best the battery don\\'t last as long as it should This phone sucksIt can\\'t run any games and it is always delayed when I type or when I scroll and every once in awhile the phone just doesn\\'t want to charge The main reason I chose this phone was speed, and S6 has that in spades. I write software for a living and tried many things to keep my old phone fast, yet despite sticking with Android 2.3.3 and refusing to update apps or install much of anything, web browsing had become an act of click a link and wait 1-5 minutes for it to load, then the screen would stall repeatedly as I tried to scroll through to read the page. If I had to click another link, the waiting process began again. Although other apps on the phone were reasonably fast, web sites had bloated enough that browsing was intolerable with a phone released in 2010 and many sites would not function correctly unless I updated the browser and made things even slower. The same sites on S6 work great, are nearly instant to load, and there\\'s no lag at any time. It\\'s amazing.I went from a Google G1 to G2 (HTC Vision) because I didn\\'t want to lose a physical keyboard, but I\\'m happy to say that the screen on the S6 is so large that I have no problem typing accurately without a physical keyboard. The screen clarity and resolution are insane. Some big-name reviewers claim there\\'s no point in having so much resolution, but it\\'s really a joy to see tiny, clear labels with extra info in various apps, to look at photos with absolutely no pixelation, and to remote-control other computer screens with no loss of detail. The S6 at 2560x1440 pixels has more resolution than my desktop monitor at 1920x1200!The camera is even more impressive with its 5312x2988 max resolution. It\\'s got enough res to virtually zoom in to 8x during photo or video recording without complete loss of detail. The camera beats my Canon Vixia HF100 1080p camcorder by a mile with better resolution and much more detail in the lightest and darkest areas. Big review sites say this is pretty much the best phone camera on the market and it\\'s nice to always have a good camera with you for unexpected shots. Even the focus speed is far faster than the camcorder and the phone has a built-in ability to do awesome things like stitching panoramic shots together as you pan the phone across a landscape or taking shots with multiple focus points and combining them to make everything clear. Of course the camcorder can still zoom farther with optical zoom to catch distant wildlife so the phone isn\\'t a complete replacement for it.Review sites consistently say the big negatives on the S6 are its battery and its delicate glass and aluminum construction. The construction can be fixed with a case like\\xa0Spigen Capsule Ultra Rugged, but I was surprised to find the battery can also be fixed with a few tweaks that weren\\'t mentioned by all those big professional review sites. During the phone\\'s initial setup screens I chose to set up a Google account, but did not set up a Samsung account or enable any Samsung features it gave options for. I also declined sending usage/diagnostic info to Samsung or Google. The first night I went to bed with the phone fully charged and pretty much only stock software installed and it was down to 56% the next morning. Terrible! Using Settings > Applications > Application Manager, I disabled the following apps and battery drain went from around 44% that first night to 3% the next night!ANT Radio Service, ANT+ Plugins Service, Briefing, Dropbox, Facebook, Gmail, Google Partner Setup, Google Play Books, Google Play Games, Google Play Movies & TV, Google Play Music, Google Play Newstand, Google+, Hangouts, Instagram, Live Weather, Memo, OneDrive, Photo Screensavers, Print Spooler, S Health, S Voice, Samsung Galaxy, Samsung Link Platform Connect, Theme Store, Virtual tour, Weather DaemonBased on what I\\'ve read, these are all safe apps to disable. In fact, unless you root the phone, I don\\'t think the phone will let you disable anything unsafe because the disable button was greyed out on about half the things I looked at. Now I don\\'t know which of the above apps are the real battery hogs, so if you see something up there you actually want to use, hopefully it won\\'t kill your battery to enable it. The phone also comes with a \"Smart Manager\" app where you can click \"RAM\", then \"Manage Apps\" tab and set particular apps to be killed 10 minutes after the screen is turned off. So if you find a particular app is killing your idle battery, adding it to the list might help. It doesn\\'t look like you can add any of the stock software to the \"auto stop\" list, unfortunately, but maybe if some of the things above were enabled they would appear on the list.Over the next few days I installed all my usual apps, including Avast! antivirus which I was worried about, and the phone remains blazing fast and still loses almost nothing with the screen off. In fact I think it was 73% when I went to bed and 73% when I got up this morning. Batteries don\\'t lose power linearly so it doesn\\'t seem unreasonable that it\\'s sticking in the 70s.I kind of wish they\\'d have given it a larger battery anyway, since most of its competitors have larger batteries, but that would have added to the weight and for my use, the current battery seems to be more than enough. I don\\'t go out a lot or spend much time using my phones, but when I do have a bit of down time, it will be nice to browse the web without the horrible lag. The other thing that worries me is previous phone batteries have always swollen after 2-3 years and forced me to replace them. This is mostly due to bad phone hardware not limiting the battery charge so extra current just gradually damages and swells the battery. I eventually worked around it using Tasker to turn the charger on/off using an X10 module and keep the phone between 70-80% charge. I\\'ve had zero swollen batteries since then and will do the same thing with the S6. But for those that always leave it on the charger to keep it at 100% most of the time, I\\'m worried the battery will swell and crack the glass back of the phone. Hopefully Samsung has set the charger system up to prevent that but it was a big problem with my last two phones. I recommend trying not to leave the phone near 100% charge just in case.Another reason I wish they\\'d put in a bigger battery is that the phone would be thicker and they wouldn\\'t need to leave the camera sticking out of the back. Having the camera like that is ridiculous and forces everyone to buy a case that protrudes enough to protect the camera from slapping down on a hard surface and cracking. That camera is definitely by biggest fear when it comes to damaging this phone and I\\'m sorely tempted to buy a case that covers the back with thick rubber right up to near the edge of the camera. Yet that ruins the beauty of the phone\\'s back so the camera design just sucks. I\\'ve never bothered with cases on my previous phones because I so rarely drop them, although they\\'ve each survived a few falls over the years, but the S6 looks so fragile I ended up using\\xa0Spigen Neo Hybrid EX\\xa0to give it some protection and to prevent the camera from contacting a table surface when the phone is on its back. The case has feet at all four corners that give it enough thickness to prevent the camera touching, but if any of the small feet end up off the table the camera still touches, which is annoying. I had to add extra padding to\\xa0CHOETECH QI Wireless Charging Pad\\xa0to keep the camera from scraping on it.If you do need a bigger battery there are cases you can buy with a battery built in. Such cases do add weight and usually block the wireless charging ability of the phone, though it would make sense if they developed a battery case that could charge itself wirelessly.Fast charging:I doubt I\\'ll use it much, but the phone comes with a special \"adaptive fast charger\" that will take the phone from 5% to about 50% in 30 minutes by dumping in 9V instead of the usual 5V. Charging speed is reduced the closer the phone gets to full. The fast charger is supposed to detect what it\\'s connected to and operate at 5V on normal devices, but I read that someone plugged it in to a PS4 controller and fried the controller. They repeated the experiment 3 more times (dishonestly returning the broken controllers to the store to exchange for new ones) and it happened every time. Of course, maybe the guy was lying to get attention or had a defective fast charger, but he sounded serious so I figured I\\'d pass on the warning not to risk using the fast charger on anything other than the phone.Wireless charging:Samsung seems to have put its charging coil at a slightly non-standard height in the phone because every upright wireless charger I looked at had complaints that the S6 would only charge on its side or upside down. The CHOETECH charger I link above had the fewest complaints, but the phone still doesn\\'t always link with it in the upright position. Interestingly, when I added the Spidgen bumper \"case\" to the phone, it connects to the charger with pretty much 100% reliability so maybe Samsung had their thinking cap on assuming almost nobody would use the phone without a case and they positioned the charging coil so it\\'s appropriate only with a case. Still, I think the coil is barely within alignment tolerances and so the phone charges slowly. Also note that although I\\'ve seen sellers of wireless chargers claim they can \"fast charge\" the phone, the charging coil in the phone is not physically able to take in power as quickly as the 9V wired fast charger can put out. In fact, I\\'ve seen complaints that wireless charging can\\'t always keep up with the amount of power this phone uses to play video or do other things with the screen on. I have a feeling that\\'s because the charging coils aren\\'t aligning well and/or the phone hasn\\'t been tweaked to limit the amount of background crap it\\'s constantly doing with some apps.Rooting:Samsung has special hardware protection that will permanently mark your phone as compromised if you root it using most methods, though there are some ways around it. When your phone gets marked, they call it \"blowing the KNOX fuse\" and supposedly if that happens you can\\'t use Samsung Pay and your warranty might be voided. I\\'ve rooted my previous two phones but haven\\'t generally found the extra \"powers\" to be useful so I\\'m leaning towards leaving the S6 stock.Thumb-print scanner:This is a very cool way of protecting your phone from unwanted users, although it\\'s really a false sense of security. It will likely guard against friends or family mucking with your phone, but a thief (or a techie friend/family) can reboot the phone holding power, volume up, and home button to enter a bootloader mode where they can overwrite the boot loader and get at the phone\\'s data. So the thumb scanner and the \"find lost device\" features might slow or stop someone who doesn\\'t know what they\\'re doing, but a real thief will turn off the phone as soon as they have it and never boot it to let you find it again. Anyway, the thumb scanner itself is decent but I seem to hit it at the wrong angle at least a third of the time and have to carefully move my thumb to be perfectly straight and centered on the scanner. I thought maybe if I moved my thumb to various slight angles and off center during thumb print training it might help but it seemed to make it worse. Then I thought maybe I could set up three versions of my thumb - straight on, slightly left, slightly right - but you can only program four finger prints total. So I trained it for both my thumbs and one index plus one for my wife. It\\'s a disappointing limitation. Using the thumb scanner is reasonably fast when it works, but it feels slower than a simple pattern I used with my old phone, so I\\'m not sure if I\\'ll stick with it.You can wake the phone by pressing the thumb scanner button but if you don\\'t lift your thumb off and put it back down after pressing the button, it never scans it as a valid thumb print. This is very annoying. We also discovered that if you fail to scan your thumb too many times, the phone locks down and _requires_ you to type the backup password. I\\'m not sure how many failed attempts turn on lockdown, but my wife caused it to happen on a trip when she repeatedly unlocked the phone to take photos. If you don\\'t have your unlock password memorized and it\\'s written on a paper at home, this could ruin a trip. This \"feature\" is even more annoying in that it doesn\\'t say the phone has disabled the thumb scanner. Instead it shows the normal lock screen but when you put your thumb down it does nothing - no unlock and no vibrate to indicate it didn\\'t recognize your thumb. I thought maybe my thumb scanner had broken but after typing the unlock password it\\'s worked fine for days.In \"Settings > Lock screen and security > Secure lock settings > Smart lock\" you can enable other methods of unlocking the phone. These include saying \"OK Google\" in your voice, having the phone at a particular known GPS location, having the phone paired to a trusted bluetooth device (car, watch, etc), or having the phone up against an NFC (Near Field Communication) sticker. Of course, if you tell the phone to remain unlocked when near your watch, and a thief demands your watch and your phone, well... You can also tell the phone not to lock as long as you\\'re holding it or have it in your pocket. I have no idea how it knows when you\\'re holding it or have it in your pocket, but the description of the feature claims it knows that somehow.\"Gold\" vs \"Platinum Gold\" color:The Amazon listing shows a choice of Gold vs Platinum Gold color. I picked \"Gold\" and was excited to finally be getting a gold phone, but the box that arrived showed \"Platinum Gold\". ARGH! Researching online, it appears the S6 is only made in 3 colors: Black, white, and platinum gold. So the \"Gold\" option on Amazon is a mistake. The phone has a hint of gold to it in certain lights but most of the time it looks silver and the gold tone is never more than subtle.Overall an amazing phone. Screen and camera quality are perfect. My only complaints are smaller than average battery and the camera that sticks out the back. For my uses, the battery size doesn\\'t matter. If I ever crack the camera due to its ridiculous sticky-outy design, I\\'ll probably come back and knock a couple stars, but for now I\\'m happy. EXCELENTE Loving my blu I was sold a bad cell The phone was and is as described. The price was a smoking deal, and I could not be happier. pictures bad internet terrible would not buy this pnone for any thing other than texting or calls but have be close to tower for good calls. Never work right. Returned. great use for international travel It works perfectly outside of US. got this phone for a friend, simple easy to use for someone wanting simple with out all the extras, just a basic phone Very good product, I recommend purchase, works very well in Venezuela The phone itself is great but the software contains a bug that drains the battery fast even while it\\'s asleep. Apparently the bug causes the phone not to enter sleep properly and also a bug dealing with WiFi scanning. Sony is suppose to provide a fix at some point. I like the phone so much that I would like to deal with it until the update but the bug is so bad that I don\\'t think that\\'s possible. For example, my phone had around 55-65% left and after 8 hours of absolutely no use, the battery was completely dead. Even using temporary fixes people provide online couldn\\'t alleviate the problem for me. I\\'m disappointed that I am going to have to return and look for something else because it has a great screen, takes fabulous pictures, speaker is loud but sounds a little \"tin-y\" and seems to be the perfect size I\\'m looking for in a phablet. The white option for this phone makes it look sick as well. The only things I would change is have the volume rocker more towards the top of the phone on the side instead of in the middle on the side, move the on/off button to the top of the phone. Moving these would make it easier to use and would make finding a car mount easier. Have a user replaceable battery, and have the phone charge faster (they advertise that it\\'s a fast charge, but coming from a Samsung note 4, it\\'s far from a fast charge. Might have to buy a different charger to accomplish that). And fix the battery drain bug asap.UPDATE: If anyone has purchased this phone and is dealing with the battery drain issue, I have been able to decrease the battery drain by installing the app: 360 Battery Plus and also turning off WiFi scanner in the settings menu. This seems to have made the issue more tolerable if you decide to keep the phone until Sony fixes it. Hope this helps you like it did for me. Amazing came exactly on my birthday thank you. When I bought this phone, it arrived packaged as new, and it worked and looked fine with no problems. However, it came with iOS 7.1.1, which is rather confusing since that OS came out more than 2 years after the phone did. When I questioned the seller about it, they said that it was updated by Apple before they liquidated the phone off to the seller. Since I had specifically wanted it to have the original iOS, I returned it without any hassle.TL;DR - If you want the original iOS, don\\'t buy this phone. I was pleased with the product and it\\'s functions. It\\'s very responsive and light weight. I have big hand and I sometimes forget and I block the mic on the Bottom. Product exactly as advertised Excellent Not very good I am buying these for the two landlines I transferred to T-mobile. I have a personal cell spot so reception is superb in my house. However, the phone seemed to drop connection when not being used. When I click on call button to turn on the screen, I often see the connections of both lines in emergency or unavailable status. But then will connect to TMO after a a few seconds. The call quality is spotty at best. When I take the phone to a Starbucks next door, the phone lost cell signals.So, the phone is kind of in working condition in my house and seemed to be useless when traveling. I am giving it 3 stars since it works sometimes in my house and does what I need for now. The radio and flashlights are also good features if I don\\'t use it as a phone long term. I got the phone blocked and now I have to pay $50 to unlock it. Just Love it I purchased this phone almost a month ago. I was a bit skeptical at first to try it, because of some other reviews I saw. I decided to give this phone a try anyway, just to go with my own instinct. I am very glad I did. The Nokia C6 is a wonderful touchscreen phone. This is my third nokia and I must say that I have never been let down by the brand. I pretty much love everything about this phone. The phone is amazing but the charger put with it did not work. I had a s2 lite before. This S4 is pretty good. I do recommend. good Works perfectly 😀😀😀 Sister loves it. Item is just like it says. Works well with AT&T. Good and working I would never buy this phone. Its very hard to type a text. My fingers are small and still struggled to type the intended letter. Battery doesnt last long and with hardly using it. exelente Returned but bought iPhone 6 Plus buy the phone that was not what I reach my destination I bought the 7582 and came als model 7562 I expect a prompt solution. She loves the phone but it has a bad charger and I have yet to hear back from them and I\\'m not happy about it. The battery drains out quickly, remaining features are good. It has everything I need from a smartphone plus the great look and feel of the htc sense and the phone design.Battery lasts 1 day with use and I get close to 2 days with no intensive use of camera and calls and without 4g (only wireless).This is my third HTC phone and I think will not be the last one. The phone is pretty quick and responsive, it doesnt have any lags or crashes with any apps so far.Totally recomended for a person that wants to buy an android phone, HTC has the best android phones! Nice Phone. I plan to return this item because, shortly after received, the navegation ball did not work well. I do not know what caused this nor do I know if the item was actually a refurbished instead of a new one as I had ordered. Hooked up to service and works great! the person who sold this to me had to take it back. presumably it was unlocked by att, but tethering remained locked. Excellent product 100% recommended very good thanks for all your kind attention to quality Poor quality. Before I bought this one I owned 3 of these EVOs, so yes I am hard on them. After a couple week the touch screen began to act funny. Eventually I was more of a headache using it than not having a phone. This is a great phone but don\\'t buy it here. el telefono se considera bueno con sus aplicaciones para un uso normal. en realidad satisface las espectativas. viene desbloqueado y funciona con cualquier operador. It\\'s my first purchase of a cellular Internet , this wine with microphone problems and dirty, but said that she looked like was not so new . I like it for the operating system you have. The chassis of the phone is very vulnerable, although the display supports many hits . Perfect Fantastic phone defective damaged power button and battery back BEAUTIFUL THE PHONE AND SOLVED THE PROBLEM WITH THE RELEASE ... RESPONSIBLE PEOPLE FORM VERY VERY FAST AND EASY RESOLVED THE PROBLEM THE THANK RECOMMEND first week awesome after that phone would lose charge fast and soon stopped charging all together Ok Excelent phone! Excelent features! The version that came to me was the chinese version of the phone (it came without the CyanogenMod logo and with the charger included 😀) with the chinese version of CyanogenMod 11 ROM. Anyway I was able to flash the latest american version of CyanogenMod 11s! 100% recommended! Good phone, powerfull, low price!!!!! I like this phone i got what i want i liked keypad and touch both and it has all i want i love this watch cell phone E Smart.it connect with my cell phone without no problem.love ittttttt.... Very nice well taken care of phone.... Works great! it arrived ok Does not work well!!! Does not receive messages, does not notify, does not allow for calls, etc. In order for it to function, you need to take out the phone which defeats the purpose of the watch. Do not recommend! My wife has had this phone for several years, at the beginning using the apps was super fast and the battery could easily go for two maybe three days. Then for the last several months it started to last only for 10 hours, using apps would be sluggish, and the phone would overheat.Verizon looked at it and replaced it with a referb phone, it too had the same issues.Thinking that if I could have a phone like it I could reconfigure it to work like it use to, then I could also fix my wifes. My mistake, after buying this phone for myself and spending two weeks with it I\\'ve decided it is a lost cause. looking on the web I\\'ve found several post indicating that it\\'s last upgrade to Android 4.1.2 is a likely cause and the system developers have thrown in the towel in trying to resolve the issues.I guess if I could have rooted the phone and revert it to an earlier Android version then it may be OK. But I had to stop and just bought both of us a Moto X no contract. Exactly what I wanted, and got here quickly. Thanks. Nice phone with all the necessary smart features with reasonable price range.Body is little delicate but if you use good cover there should no be issue. Thanks again Phone does not work and it was never reset the software cant be returned to original software is a scammer levanta 4g ,un sr telefono I have to give this phone a perfect rating. Considering the limited number of prepaid phones T-mobile offers, this is quite the deal. Although it is an international version, mostly sold in UK I believe, and the fact that the manual is in another language, I give this phone a high rating. The touch screen is fantastic, the camera is okay, the music playing system is great, the additional stylus pen (I don\\'t really use it)is okay, and the opportunity to expand memory is unbeatable. The downside is that you can\\'t really use the web or set up an e-mail (no wi=fi), and the phone is a bit slow loading your entire music/pictures, and multitasking is nearly impossible. Regardless, if you want a stylish phone that performs fundamental functions and you have AT&T or T-mobile and want an inexpensive phone, I highly recommend this phone! I bought 2, both runs very slow, batteries last like 10 minutes fully charged, keyboard is delayed, charging port is loose. Terrible phone. Do not waste your money Received the phone exactly as described. It was unlocked, and my T-Mobile (US) sim card was recognized right away. The phone came in packaging from a Latin American country, but the (brief) instruction manual included is printed in English. When you first turn on the phone it gives you an option to proceed in Spanish, Portuguese or English. I pressed 3 and my phone was configured for English. The whole process is simple, and I didn\\'t experience any of the negative issues past reviewers have complained about--they seem to have worked out those problems. It\\'s awesome The phone is nice. Almost perfect condition. The only thing i miss is the LED flash for notifications. but its worth it if you dont mind that. The phone was labeled on Amazon as \"new\", but when I went to get it set up, they told me this phone has a contract on it with another carrier and can\\'t be set up till the contract is paid off. Not very happy with \"ChubbiesTech\". The phone guy chuckled when I told him we got it from ChubbiesTech because he said it happens a lot with their phones. Totally pleased with quaity, speed of shipping, and cost. Excellent, i like this product Meet my expectations! Excellent phone, fast! This phone is amazing in terms of performance and battery life. It can run Pokémon Go with music playing and a dozen background apps open without a hiccup and while consuming less battery than you would expect. As a long time iPod and iPhone customer this has exceeded all of my expectations. Great phone I highly recommend buying it I received it in 4 days and there\\'s barely any wear or tear. Literally brand new Not good, because microphone does not work. It is a great cheap phone. It\\'s quite a good phone. Was able to meet my needs but the only problem is the battery. It doesn\\'t take me for a day when fully charged Perfect cellphone.pro: Lovely and comfortable keyboard which is quite rare on the market. Adorable looking, acceptable price, long battery life (mine lasts 3 days without heavy usage), powerful OS runs smoothly.con: Shortage in software (I update it to 10.3.1 and android software runs more beautifully now, but still could be improved). It is the only drawback I noticed so far and I do not mind it that much.I like it. Just recieved this phoneand it is scratched TERRIBLY and won\\'t take a charge as the charger that came with it causes the phone to say unauthorized cable! second buy from amazon and second huge dissapointment! Serious connectivity issues on 3G network after a few days. Got as a gift for my dad and he loves it. It\\'s really simple for him to use. Only 2 problem we had with it was front facing camera isn\\'t good and doesn\\'t connect to WiFi. It\\'s a good looking phone but it would look better if they slimmed it down a little. good phone, but the charger cable isn\\'t compatible with the phone: it\\'s not a apple cable!!! i must buy a new apple cable: 30$.... :(( Ok Guys please, if you don\\'t know what to do with your money, buy that phone you will have it used for 2 weeks only, cause this is the first crap phone I ever have, I purchased that phone for my birthday, not it stop working, I never dropped that phone and I never put it in the water cause I know it\\'s not a waterproof phone, It was in charge one day when I took it to place a phone call, the phone died I can\\'t do nothing with it, I don\\'t why this seller sold that phone in amazon to steel people money, even though you got refund when you contact amazon and return the defective Item, but it\\'s not fair to purchase something and after 2 weeks you start having problem with it, so I encourage everyone to not buy that phone, if you smoke please stay smoking instead of buying that phone cause this one will take you feeling away while using that crap phone...Don\\'t tell me that the phone worth the price, or it is a cheap phone, you don\\'t purchase something for the price but you purchase something for you to use in it suppose to be a good quality phone, honestly I regret that I used my debit card on some s*** like that.... \"DO NOT BUY IT\" I\\'m saying, Money is not easy to make, you got to spend a lot hours in order to have $49, so you can\\'t throw it away like that. (a word to salvation) great did what it was supposed to. The tablets stop working just after three days....don\\'t know hw to return it Was not unlock Didn\\'t get expected product.Sim slot is Jammed. battery life is bad.took hours to chargekept on restarting after few minutes had it a few days not and so far it is a great phone I purchased this product with prime exclusive pricing with ads in the lock screen, thinking as the description implies the ads would come up like a notification in your lock screen. This was not the case; if your screen was asleep, a full page ad would appear after your lock screen in essence adding an additional step to unlocking the phone. This was much more annoying than originally anticipated and within 3 hours I returned the phone. I am so happy that I was able to get this iPhone6s over the summer for a great deal. The phone came well packaged with a charger and had no dents or scratches. I have now used it for 3 months with a full suite of apps (20gb) and have had absolutely no problems (touch ID, 3D touch, touchscreen, battery) with heavy daily use. I have been an iphone user for a couple of months now and am very happy with this upgrade. I will update this review if I have any problems with the phone in the future. i do not recommend for use without case and screen protectorafter a month of use:- glass have scratches- plastic edge of the display is damagedandroid 6 do not available on current date (26.02.2016) - current version 5.0.2 It\\'s ok but the constant updates mess with the usage. It\\'s so excelent!!! Thanks This phone is the second order from this seller. First one was not an unlocked, I returned it.And also this is not an unlocked phone unfortunately...!It is described as an unlocked. Why?? Is waste of time for me, I am very anxious...!If you need an unlocked phone look for an other seller. Blu Studio C MiniAlot of people are getting 5\" to 6\" screen sizebut this 4.7\" screen is more than enough for me.Pretty Good PhoneI like that it has no bloatwareI\\'m glad I got It. Bought this 6 months ago to replace my iPhone after 4 yrs of having an Apple phone. I love the 5.5\" screen. This phone has a lot of bloatware and took a lot of time figuring out how to hide icons that could not be deleted. Consider another brand with less superfluous icons and maybe for less money. Awsome ..love this phone!! Came in perfect condition...no broken seal!!..100% satisfied! great product Bought it for a friend ,he just charged and placed his sim and that was it ,came with a leather pouch to hold the phone on your waist . IT WORKS GREAT. Bought this for my husband. He does love it, however it drains his phone too much and too fast. Had this phone for almost a year now, and it is by far the best phone I ever had. Firstly, I love asphalt 8, airborne, but it says \\'sorry, this app can not work on your device\\'. Secondly, the finishing is not good, no quality control. Netflix also doesn\\'t seem to work on it either, but every other thing is perfect the audio is very low in calls practically I have to put the phone in my ear to listen, the Fonts size are too small and those are not clear.Practically lost my money whit this Newsunshine AN1 android 4.1 dual core 2.0 Ordered this as a gift for my daughter\\'s 17th birthday and so far she\\'s in love with it. Everything was as described and it even arrived earlier than expected! excellent, very good service software problem WiFi and Bluetooth is not working and also automatically restarting. Amazing quality. I knew what i was receiving because i already owned an iphone 5S. Unexpected fast delivery. Definitely will buy again ( if i break this one..haha) WINE WITH PHONE CHARGER DAMAGED The phone works perfectly, fast, accurate. Communication programs work perfect, it is the reason for my purchase. The touch keyboard is not very practical because sometimes you touch more than one letter. The camera is not good, the definition is very poor, but I never chose it by the camera, for that I have a much more effective digital camera.. It is not all that. It was everything I expected ! ...I\\'m very impressed with the phone and it came with the 5.0 android update I will wear it as a watch and nothing else. I cant answer calls with it even when connected to bluetooth. I love this device what can I say we all have blu in our home I can\\'t stay off my phablet it is amazing what will blu think of next. NO SIM CARD CAN\\'T READ INSTUCTIONS JUST A BIG PAIN IN THE BUTT START TO FINISH , IF YOU COULD FINISH. CONTACTED SELLER SEVERAL TIME, TO BAD YOU CAN\\'T UNDERSTAND THEM ANY BETTER THEN THE INSTUCTIONS!!!PLUS IT COST MORE THEN THE WATCH TO RETURN. WOULD NEVER BUY FROM THEM AGAIN. Hi. Im bought this phone like a month ago and the phone is not function. I need to know what im dping to fix the problem. Thanks a lot and i wait your answer very soon. Bye good My son likes his i-phone Great Product excellent phone I bought for my son and it has dropped to the stairs and the phone still works This is a fantastic phone, especially for the price! Coming from a Samsung GS4 (which I loved), I was looking for a bigger screen and an escape from bloatware. This phone offered both those needs and gives the quality I\\'ve become used to, with my previous Androids. I\\'m very careful with my phones, but feel a little better knowing this one won\\'t cost me $800 to replace if I accidentally damage it. The screen resolution is great, and the 13mp camera takes excellent pictures. I wouldn\\'t hesitate to buy another one if these. the only thing with these is after about 6 months of using, the screen would constantly keep freezing and sometimes blackout Horrible!!!! charging port on phone came out and replacement phone would not charge and volume didn\\'t work. The HTC incredible 2 was the sorriest piece of junk I ever bought. Very unhappy and dissatisfied with my purchase. DON\\'T DESERVE A STAR!!!! This phone has exceeded my expectations!! I couldn\\'t bought a better phone. Good!!! I moved from S2 to S4 and I\\'m really happy with it as I was with the S2. The screen is really big and clear without the phone being as bulky as the Note. I wear this on my belt. The new features work fine. The 13MP camera looks amazing as you take pictures. The problem is that you have to take pictures very still. You almost need to use a tripod. If you move just a little, the picture ends up blurry. Now the video it takes looks just amazing.The battery doesn\\'t last more than half a day, but I do use it a lot for internet, videos and games so I\\'m used to charging it all night and at work. The processors are really fast and you now have a lot of memory. Enough to have multiple big programs open without issue. I used to have some issues installing many apps in my S2 because of small internal memory (not everything could be moved to the SD). I haven\\'t had to worry about that with the S4 yet. I also tested the screen mirroring feature with a nice Samsung tv and there was some lag but it was OK. When watching a video, you can just send the video instead of the screen and then there is no lag. I also considered the S5 but this one was $400 and the S5 was more than $600.Overall really happy with it. If I learn how to configure the camera so the shutter is faster or it compensates for slight hand movements I will never let go of this phone. Seems decent so far. Very good Very good If not connected to Wi-fi, Internet does not work at all. Camera has a spot from factory. Slow. Almost every call drops or does not get through. Do not waste your money buying from this seller. Checked SIM, band, software, carrier plan, it just does not work as expected. Added photos of camera issue. This is my first ever iphone and I LOVE it so much. Thank you Nice phone. Meets the expectations. Good product,fast deliverd,happy This was a store demo phone, you CANNOT remove the demo software that takes over the phone shortly after turning it on. Verizon store actually tried for me but were unsuccesfful and said these phones are not supposed to ever get out to the public. Makes me wonder how the company got a hold of them. This s4 very good Purchased this item, the phone works fine but i was expecting a frost blue phone but got a tacky sky blue instead....big disappointment excelente. The voice reception was not clear. I have a few minor problems with this phone, however, overall it is great for a replacement until I can upgrade on my contract. Love my phone This phone sucks. Freezes up a lot and won\\'t load web pages. I regret buying it. Phone looks new and has clean imei. Not black listed nor has a balance due. No problems with it so far (only been a couple days)Would of givin a 5 star review but it says it\\'s brand new and when I went to put my SIM card in the phone there was already an att sim installed. Found that weird. Overall though it seems like a great phone. As someone who just wants a good *small phone*, for making phone calls, I found myself buying this one because it was literally the only small phone I could find (the phone I replaced was a bar phone the size of a Chicklets box). Every other option available now is either a smart phone or cheap flip-phone garbage.So I chose this phone entirely for its size, not because it\\'s a smart phone (keyboard way too small to type on), and I was very pleasantly surprised at the call quality on the handset and when using bluetooth. I *DO* recommend this phone if you just want something small for making calls, but don\\'t get your hopes up.Having said that, you get what you pay for:- The pictures provided by the manufacturer are *very* misleading, showing a standard Android Launcher screen, when in fact this phone has a cheap, custom UX that tries and fails to look like iOS.- For no discernible reason, this custom UI doesn\\'t use Android standards — for example… - There is no Apps Tray, and instead all your apps are on your homescreen whether you like it or not - It has a Recent Apps button, but it\\'s inexplicably used for Settings instead - Recent Apps is instead found only by holding down the Home button- The paltry user guide has *no* instructions of any kind about this nonsense custom UI, so you\\'re completely on your own for figuring out stuff like how to reach Recent Apps, so good luck figuring out how to add widgets or rearrange the home screens (tap and hold on empty spot of Launcher)- Instead of using the perfectly fine Android Contacts app, there\\'s a custom contacts app that leaves a lot to be desired- You can\\'t edit or delete Contacts stored on your SIM card (but you can add new SIM contacts) - (You\\'ll have to download \"SIM Contacts\" by PenumbraApps from Play Store - https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.penumbra.apps.SIM_Contacts_Manager- The maximum volume on the handset isn\\'t loud enough- The maximum volume on the speakerphone *really, really* isn\\'t loud enough- You can\\'t change lock screen background to pic — you\\'re stuck with what they give you- Because of screen size, keyboard is nearly impossible to type on - Download \"TouchPal,\" which is a) the best keyboard for Android anyway, b) allows you to resize it (I can type on this one)- Status bar shows mobile & wifi signal strength, but *doesn\\'t show bluetooth status* (again, silly custom UI) - However, there is a Power Control widget you can put on the home screen for that- The battery monitor is wildly inaccurate- If you keep your phone numbers on your SIM, the Direct Dial widget thinks *every* phone number is a mobile phone, and you can\\'t change it- The accelerometer is sketchy — when pulling phone down from face during call, screen comes on only about 1/10th of the time - Worse, power button doesn\\'t start up the screen during calls about 60% of the time eitherIf anyone else made decent small feature phones anymore, I probably wouldn\\'t have even looked at this one. But if you want a small phone with decent call quality, you\\'re pretty much stuck with this. I needed to get a basic phone and this one meets my expectation. I would recommend this phone as a good basic phone. You can\\'t watch YouTube videos on this phone but other than that it\\'s a good phone I have been tracking this phone ever since the Nov 2012 release, and I generally had mixed feelings about the types of reviews I read all over the internet. There have been complaints about the weight, about lack of an SD card slot, about it being a Windows phone, the list goes on. However, from experiencing this device for myself, I have to say that while it is not the perfect smartphone, it excels in most areas.The phone weighs 185g - considerably more than all of its direct competitors - but it does not feel like an anvil. It more has a solid, almost unbreakable feel (though I\\'m not gonna test that). The Samsung Galaxy S3 was one of the main competitors at release date, and though it is lighter and thinner than the Lumia 920, it also feels quite frail in comparison. I don\\'t find the weight of the phone to be a negative attribute.One other concern I had was how the WP8 environment would treat me, as it is well documented and demonstrated all over that the Windows App Store is leagues behind Google and iOS. There are obviously missing popular apps (not least Instagram and Youtube), but I have been able to find ample replacements so far (Metrotube and 6Tag) that do the job. If you aren\\'t one to obsess over a name, then you will find these apps more than capable of handling most, if not all of your activities.The phone boasts silky smooth performance, with great visuals and above average speaker output. As far as media storage goes, I\\'m not too concerned about the lack of SD card slot. The device already comes with 32gb built-in. Most other flagships at release date topped out at 16gb and not all offered SD storage either.The camera is probably the strongest selling point on any current-gen high end Nokia phone, and believe me, these guys have a right to brag. The camera is simply amazing, and there are a bunch of Nokia-exclusive imaging apps that make the photo experience so much better.Battery life is what I would call average from a smartphone these days and it is probably the biggest negative point on my mind right now. Depending upon usage and settings, battery life can vary greatly. If you are one of the users who turns screen brightness down all the way, turns off all services, and keeps the phone running on barebones features, then you can crank 2 days out of the battery easily. If you are like me - a moderate to heavy user who keeps his screen settings on automatic and doesn\\'t bother to turn off things other than location settings, then you will get upwards of 11 hours out of a full charge. I\\'ve seen better, but I\\'ve also seen worse.Overall, I\\'m satisfied with the phone. It was either this or a Xperia Z from Sony. The two are totally different experiences, but both have their strong and weak points. The price difference will probably play a role in the decision as well if you are torn between these 2 (though the release of the Z1 will surely drop the Z\\'s price some more). For anybody questioning why I chose the Lumia 920 over the 925, the reasons are simple.The 925 only has 16gb onboard storage as opposed to 32gb on the 920.The 925 does not have a camera that much better than the 920The 925 did not come in red :) Perfect condition and works great. This phone was awesome for the one hour that it worked the pictures it took looked great the porcessor was decently fast and ran youtube like a charm. And for those of you who have cricket yes it will automatically pick up your wireless signal and display on the dropdown menu cricket 3g or 4g. But having said what the positive thigns about htis phone was it crashed and got a green screen which then turned red and then would not respond to factory data reset or battery being taken out and placed back in. All in all what looked like a great deal turned outto dissapoint me, remmeber when buying this phone or this brand it is known but not extremely well known so you run the risk of getting a phone that will burn out early. I ordered this phone and it was just great. Lasted loooooong time, was resistant, efficient and excellent. All that is expected from Nokia and much more. I used this phone for over a month. It works great. Great phone. Great phone. Great phone. It does so much. It is very fast. The battery lasts a lot longer than my last phone and charges up quickly. There are so many things this phone can do. Totally awesome Great phone, came from Samsung devices and want to try HTC for a while now, it doesn\\'t let me down, was worried about several reviews on the device about camera and battery quality, don\\'t know if in some patches I received from HTC those problems were solved but for me the camera is fine (not as good as Samsung but that\\'s not a big issue for me) and battery life really impress me, I use the power saving option turned on always, maybe it has something to do but with medium use the phone have more than 50% at the end of my day, and that\\'s better than Samsung in my experience. The phone is a computer, the hardware specs are great and it behave like what it is, a computer grade phone. There are some functionalities from HTC that I like a lot, the keyboard is great, really responsive (my advice is that you take the time to make a calibration fro your fingers, that helps a lot), the theme mode for icons and screen is fine, a lot to customize and a lot of great themes available. This is a review after a month of use, let\\'s see how it behave in time. The iphone 4 worked pretty good for 15 days but started acting up when I pushed the home button. It has 60% before I went to bed and at some point through the night it died. Very disappointed because this is my business phone. Didn\\'t tell me about no charger or anything I ordered 2 of these phones (1 for me and 1 for my hubby). They are both perfect and work well with our carrier! Thank you so much!! Gave this phone as a present,but only lasted about a month,very cheap and could not load some apps. The phone I brought was good up until it dropped an the screen came out Love muy new iPhone I had this phone myself. This was for my husband. I found it very easy to use. I LIKE IT Great Phone OS is so easy to use and smooth. I don\\'t install the latest developer updates so I have not noticed any bugs. After a few charges the battery easily lasts all day and I only charge it at night. The integration with Xbox and other windows 10 devices through Cortana is fantastic.Not a lot of apps but with Windows 10 Universal Apps taking off there are new apps every week. I don\\'t use a ton of apps so not a big problem for me. Continuum is great but I don\\'t use it much as when ever I need a computer I always have my laptop with my any way.The phone is everything I wanted it to be and the best phone I ever had. Like with all Lumina phones the camera is still one of the best for any phone.Only thing that bugs me is that on windows 8.1 phone when you saved shortcuts from your Internet Explorer out to your desktop it saved it with an image of the web page you were on. Now just saves it as a blue Icon. I am sure this feature will come back. At the original price of $65 or $70 I probably would not have bought this case but for $20 this thing is well worth it. I can let my wife use the tablet and not be scared that she\\'s going to break it anymore because this thing is extremely strong and rugged.The snap on stand doubles as a screen protector whenever you want to store the tablet on the go and it doubles as the perfect stand to set the tablet on while watching shows in your bed or on the table.It\\'s really the perfect case at $20. Good This phone is wonderful will love to have it over and over again Unlocked Quad-band S29 Smart Watch Phone Support Camera TF Card Micro SD Card SIM Card Bluetooth Wrist SmartwatchOk, let\\'s start off with the good. For the price point this watch feels and looks pretty high end. The screen is super responsive and the UI is a bit tricky, but after 10-15 minutes I was all good with it. Charge time was decent, I went from 50% to full in under an hour. Battery life, under normal use, notifications, bluetooth connection, occasional time checking and steps, was ok, full day and it was down to about 45%. So, expect close to 2 days of usage from this watch.The bad: This is Android compatible, not Android Wear. So, there is no way to get Google Apps on this watch. You\\'re stuck with whatever apps already come with the watch. Earpiece is the USB headphones, so you can\\'t use any standard 3.5mm headset with the watch (I have Beats and it will not work with it). Even though the screen is responsive the apps are not really good and not friendly to use.This watch is an ok experiment, but if you\\'re looking for Android Wear device this is not it very simple to use..easy to understand...have a little trouble with cell reception in some areas....and the ring tone needs to be louder..but am still pleased with phone I bought that phone in order to be able to use 2 sims abroadthe phone is unlocked for all countries and providersit has good qualities also it is not high range but mid-rangeI use it mostly for emails, whatsapp and making calls and it is more than neededfor its price it is a great deal After a month or so it started messing up thinking it has the earphone jack plugged in. Now I have to always put it on speaker phone to take a call. I tried everything to fix it and it still shows the monkey with the headphones on. Excellent product Old matharbord and new cover excellent no problems all were ok Phone sucked! Had to send it back. Where can I purchase a SIM card for this phone?!?I prefer a BLU SIM card but it is a dual carrier so as long as I can purchase a SIM card that is compatible that will be fine!!!Thank You. The phone was a gift for my sister. She loves it! It never runs slow, updates are simple, great screen and delivers what you expect from a smartphone! I recommend it! If you start adding apps that clog the phone\\'s processor then the brand makes no difference... good afternoon, the team that acquired him in his store received with the problem that the keyboard does not work, which I can not porlo its use, the user manual says nothing about this kind of problem, so I am very dissatisfied with your purchase, I hope your answer and then conduct my evaluation for service Pros:- Excellent build quality, much better than Nokia\\'s and Sony Ericsson\\'s plastic toys.- Really good voice transmission, I\\'m able to talk in noisy environments, and the phone filters the interference.- Excellent MP3 quality, much better than previosuly used Nokia 5310 and Sony Ericsson W890.- Standard slots and connections: MicroSD card, micro USB connection, 3.5 headphone jack.Cons:- The menus are not great when comparing to both Nokia and SE. They\\'re not as intuitive as the others. However, they\\'re not slow, and I\\'ve not run into any bug yet.- The camera is mediocre, but this isn\\'t a cameraphone. If you need that, you should buy a Moto ZN5.Overall, I think it\\'s a great purchase for someone who looks for a phone with a great call quality and an excellent music player. The add said it was unlocked And the fact is that I still had to pay extra to someone else to really unlock it and be able to use it Was not totally new and has a \"dead\" spot in it. Cannot get the back space button to work when texting. Ok Good Phone Got it when i want to israel and it was great with long battery life I\\'ve written a detailed review on Medium. [...]Good- Unlocked- No bloatware, minimal extra apps installed- Dual SIM- SD Card slot- Screen was nice and bright with decent contrast- Performance was on par with expectations for this price range- Battery life was very impressive, but I use it mainly without a SIM card/data connection so that might help big time.- The phone was comfortable to hold and the back plastic is pretty \"grippy\" which is nice.Bad- Camera is very bad, do not buy if you plan to take lots of pictures- Not a fan of the power button. It\\'s small and I don\\'t like the ascetics or feel of it either.- Once I added a bunch of app and widgets the phone really started to slow. I ended up tweaking a bunch of start up apps and using some \"tuning\" apps to get things running faster. At&t versions are always a sh...it. Try to change the software ASAP or try to not buy this versions with it\\'s own \\'software\\' I thought I\\'d take the plunge and join the android craze. I just want my Blackberry back. This phone sucks monkey balls.- The battery life sucks. I have shut down everything in the background that should be sucking it dry (GPS, Bluetooth, etc) and I\\'m still charging it at least twice a day. I work on an ambulance.... I NEED to have a phone that I know will be charged in order to give patient reports. I can take this phone off the charger before I leave for work and by lunch time it\\'s almost dead.- I have VERY small hands... I buy little kids gloves.... and even *I* can\\'t text on this thing for crap. I feel like I should send out decoder rings with every text message.- Talk about slow. Even after I rooted it, it\\'s still insanely slow to respond. I end up in a loop every day because I hit a button then wait 60 seconds for it to respond, hit the button again only to have whatever it is pop up then go away again. Makes me want to bang my head against the wall.- My god the fingerprints. I spend all day wiping them off. One more reason I hate touch screens. With a passion.- Even rooted it\\'s a train wreck. I thought getting rid of all the bloatware would make a difference, but it doesn\\'t.- This thing looses signal ALL the time. I got full strength in my house with my Blackberry... I barely get 2 bars here.- T-Mobile isn\\'t even selling this POS anymore.- It takes it HOURS to charge fully. Sometimes it isn\\'t even charged over night.It does take decent pics and video. The back speaker is surprisingly loud.I\\'m not sure I could hate this phone more all in all. I have ordered a new battery to see if that solves some of my issues. I\\'m not holding my breath and I can\\'t wait to get rid of it. Yea its a 5S but still installed iOS 10 and works great. I first decided to buy the phone because it was relatively within my budget and I\\'ve never really been one for fancy phones. A couple weeks after I received it, the phone started acting funny. When I changed to a different screen, I\\'d notice that the screen I was on before would remain in the background FOREVER, I kid you not! Videos are not really clear, but sound quality is really good(louder than my laptop!) Overall, if you dont have another choice, it\\'ll do. But I don\\'t see it as a good quality long-term cellphone. bought this phone a few months ago. it was puschase as new sent it to my son in the caribbean at first everthing worked fine after only two weeks a couple of the buttons stop working. he took it to a blackberry store only only to be told its a refurbish product. now my problem is with amazon if u guys are going to have companies sell stuff through you then you should be held responsible for all the defective products being sold through you amazon .i have been a loyal customer to amazon and have bought other products that i am happy with but not this time around.amazon please pay attention to these reviews Great price, extremely fast shipping works as advertized! bad buy,. not good Cool I bought this phone as a replacement for a stolen iPhone and I couldn\\'t be happier. 3G, GPS, wi-fi, music, email, etc. All for 320 dolars. It\\'s very stylish as well when compared to a blackberry or other smartphones with full qwerty. I was disappointed I thought the came with a charger did not get one The battery charging time is very short. The outgoing and incoming calls do not connect sometimes I really love my phone it\\'s perfect for me Very nice phone! Performs extremely well for the price! I\\'m in love. All good 1.USB charging is faulty and loose2.Keypad sometimes freezes when I am typing3.Power saver pops up even when battery is full when I have set it at 10%For a new phone which is only less than 4 weeks old to have problems at a very early stage am wondering what willhappen in the next few months. Might end up buying another phone from the way I see it Soon after I bought this phone I noticed I wasn\\'t getting 4G LTE as promised all I was getting was H+ or 3G. I did a little digging and found this model was for if you live in Europe and the only way to get it here and have the 4G LTE work in where ever you live:Samsung SM-G900F for EuropeSamsung SM-G900I for AsiaSamsung SM-G900K/G900L/G900S for KoreaSamsung SM-G900M for VodafoneSamsung SM-G900A for AT&TSamsung SM-G900T for T-MobileSamsung SM-G900W8 for Canada Excellent This phone is awesome 😬. Thank you Good I bought this cell as a little birthday gift for my friend- he likes it! and it is not expensive, right? I purchased this item for my son who had this same Blackberry he dropped his in water so of course stop working. He is very happy with the phone so far it arrived quickly and even came with a case. We are very satisfied with this Amazon purchase. Excellent phone. It\\'s really light, very smooth and fast. Good screen and camera. It\\'s not the best phone on the market that is sure, but it\\'s the best price-performance comparison phone good So far this is a nice phone for the money. The camera makes it though. Even if I didn\\'t use it as a phone I\\'d still use it as a camera / WIFI web browser. It\\'s not the best at web browsing but functional. I\\'m using my ATT GoPhone account with a new sim card. I still had an old flip phone when ATT made me get something more up to date so I can\\'t compare. All in all though it\\'s been pretty good. I like the FM radio and weather keeping track where I am. The bluetooth connected easy to my GPS for hands on driving. Great phone for this price. Excellent phone. A little complicated to configure. Work fine overseas in both GSM and LTE. Excellent phone,I had to buy a phone with a great camera for my work, the camera is not only excellent but the phone is very easy to navigate. I use Tmobile, and the service is very good. The only issue is texting images and media which is resolved by adapting the settings to the tmobile APN, just had to search on the internet to get those codes, the only reason I was not going to give the phone 5 stars is that I have yet to figure out how to email a high res photo from the phone.I downloaded Phriz b but it is still not working,Fortunately some of my clients can accept a lower resolution, but if I could figure this issue out, this phone would be perfect, I had a Samsung galaxy prior to this, and this so much better. Just perfect! I love... Too bad it didn\\'t come with 1GB RAM thou... Very good phone Delivered as promised Works great Good job! I love it! Like new and work great also out of the USA! I would buy this phone again and again...... Makes weird sounds if you accidentally bump it almost sounds like something is breaking but nothing has broke yet I really like my new phone! It is taking me awhile to familiarize myself with it, but I have not had any major problems. The battery does seem to run down very quickly, but other than that...no problems! For a great phone, no more to say, this cell phone got everything you need, robust desing, lot of app\\'s. This phone is great and LOUD! My previous phone was a cubot and i founds it very quiet. I bought this phone for 2 reasons, 1 it was small and 2 it was a \"music\" phone. I was happy with the width as i find 5\" phones to wide for me to use. The sound was a wonderful surprise. If you are looking to play music on a phone this is a great choice. I do wish there was a nice silicone cover for the back tho. I like everything about the phone Hola, disculpen la demora, si recibi mi telefono celular curve 8520, en buenas condiciones, es facil, rapido y comodo comprar por este medio; nunca antes lo habia hecho realmente, los felicito por ser tan responsables, gracias.. so much for my 90 day warranty. Had my phone for less than 60days and now doesn\\'t work. get what you pay for. amazon didn\\'t help at all. buyer beware I love this cell phone works very good whit movistar in Venezuela I bought the Storm2 through Amazon, after reading some of the earlier reviews I was a bit skeptical of how the purchase would go but I decided to bite the bullet. The shipment came in earlier than I anticipated and the phone came in original package. The phone had some minor scratches on the back but it is in great condition. I initially had some problems using the phone outside of the US but the phone seems to have steadied a bit. I would recommend using this seller to anyone. Excellent The phone is falsely advertised as a \"8 GB internal memory\", whereas it only has 1.5 GB internal memory. Not enough internal memory, you would struggle with apps. From samsung site you can check that Rom is 8GB. excelente I have been using this P9+ VIE-L29 since I received it about 4 weeks ago. The camera is super! If you like to take pictures, you won\\'t be disappointed with the image quality.The phone is easy to set up which only took me few minutes. The smart phone started working the way it should be after plugging in a new sim card from AT&T. However I realized that the 4G label never appears next to the signals bars on the top line of the display. It stays at 3G!!! Despite the good amount of effort from Mega Mobile in helping me to try out various APN settings in addition to what I could find in the internet for AT&T networks, the P9+ that I got just does not run in 4G. I\\'ve made sure that Data is enabled on the phone and wifi is turned off but it just stays at 3G. I put another phone, Huawei P8 lite, side by side with the P8+, the much cheaper P8 lite performs in 4G but not the P9+. I live in silicon valley, 4G coverage is very good, so I am very disappointed that my P9+\\'s 4G is not working. AT&T checked on my sim card, said it is a 4G sim card. Now I am pretty much stuck. If any readers/users out there knowing what I can do, please post your suggestions. Thanks!Update (10-04-2016): Added 3 more stars.Continuing with my investigation on the 4G failure, I managed to borrow a AT&T nano sim card that is proven functioning with 4G. I plugged it into my P9+, the phone immediately operated in 4G! So, it means AT&T issued me a faulty sim card but insisted that it was all good.I took my 4-wk old P9+ to another AT&T store and asked for another sim for my 4G phone. In short, I have the 4G problem finally resolved but during the course of action, I have learned that when AT&T realized that the phone is not from the US, they would choose to disable 4G/LTE or, not to program the 4G/LTE functionality into the sim card despite the phone has the capability and 4G/LTE is being subscribed. Sad! great product Good one excelente The volume did not go as high as my old same model phone did.. Not good, arrived with broken crystal and not working at all unable to get any use out of it, wasted money No comment.... I arrive on time, present technical failures I\\'m shocked! After 7 days of using the phone, he fell from a small chair and the glass breaks into small pieces. Replacing of the glass is a half of the phone price. How can you do such a thing unreliable? phone defective damaged power button and battery back GOOD All my expectations Decent cell phone, cannot beat the price. very good phone Wrong product sent. What I ordered did not come. The correct product should be C6 not C6-01. Nice phone but not what i wanted.:( just like it! Product is 5/5 but im a little bit concerned because the seal was broken and was replaced with a fake seal. after careful examination i have found out that original seal was underneath the fake one. I\\'m in the u.s. and i had to go on a Singaporean samsung website to register my product. shouldn\\'t internationals versions be able to register from any where? so i do not know what to do if my product malfunctions. So buyer be aware. I upgraded to the S5 from the Note, and I\\'m VERY happy with it. Battery duration is way better than the Note\\'s, it\\'s fast, excellent screen size and doesn\\'t feel so bulgy in the pocket.Special kudos for the possibility of washing the device in the sink (water proof), of drawing and writing on it using a regular, graphite pencil, and for the slow motion video (240 frames per second).For my fellow citizens, it works perfectly with 4G in Brazil. Best telephone I have ever used. Excelente purchase, the phone is like new 👍 I had an issue where my charging port had entirely stopped working, making it impossible to charge this phone. I sent my phone back to BLU, who after almost 3 weeks sent me a brand new one.----As a iPhone user who looked at several Samsung phones, I was initially concerned about buying a phone that only cost $350. This thing came in a beautiful box and has a premium feel to it. It doesn\\'t feel cheap at all.Blu gives you everything with this phone: a quick charger, USB cable, two cases, NFC stickers and a screen protector.This phone has a notable screen- it is beautiful. The camera is decent and the speakers are nice and loud. You get used to the crazy size very quickly too.This phone has found a few scratches, but with no case or screen protector, I am not surprised.There are a few software quirks: android pay works now, but the notification LED seems to not be controllable by any third party app, and the settings menu is quite heavily modified by BLU. That being said, as I write this, developers are working on a custom ROM for this phone.Overall, an awesome device at an irresistible price. Phone came in perfect condition and has NO problems at all!!! It\\'s the worst I\\'ve been able to buy, is a very expensive phone and a lie that is waterproof, it accidentally submerged in a wading pool for a period less than one minute and equipment damage. No useless and I have no such contact seller for the warranty. This phone defiantly meets and exceeds all expectations and standards that are listed in the description.. I love it. the color is very vibrant and the camera/overall quality of everything is outstanding. I use it through straighttalk but the dual sim option and unlocked carriers just tops it off. Nice seller. On time. Just as expected. Recommenden Can\\'t download any pictures or upload anything!!! But it\\'s compatible with my service. very good product Excellent Very good phone the only thing I do not understand is that I get the tel no original and sealed box Yay! Glad I bought three of these tried and tested S5 phones - at least my house is not at risk of burning down.All brand new - worked great - and charge quickly.. The last Steve Jobs design. I love this format. It\\'s still a Phone. I don\\'t want a tablet on my ear. Coming from a 5s, Don\\'t see much diffrence. Love this phone. Well worth what i payed for it!! steer clear of blu, go with this phone for $60 it works well with all the standard features you need from a droid. i did not realize the phone was a Verizon phone have to return I have att carrier I am notorious for dropping my phone. Ever since I got this otterbox, I\\'ve lost the need to worry if I broke the screen or if I got water in the plug holes of my phone. And the clip on case that came with it made it easy to carry my big iPhone 5s. I am glad I got it Works great but can not download the app to use my messages on watch excelente. Got some ugly dirts on the back and could not mop off. Generally it\\'s ok with a case I love this phone. It\\'s super fast very light. I love the slim built of the phone. I would recommend this product excelent phone, i love it I will like to understand how to do a warranty refund Fast delivery. And so far works like a brand new phone. It came in perfect condition. Item arrived fast and complete. Item matched description very well. Thank you. GREAT I AM VERY PLEASED WITH THE PRODUCTS AS SHOWN IN THE PICTURES I RECOMMEND EXCELLENT PHONE AT LOW PRICE this phone was sold as new worked for 3 mnths then stopped took it to the nearest apple store which was 3 hrs away for them to tell me it was a \"frankinstien\" meaning there were some apple parts an some that were not now NOBODY will help 300$ just gone i really like the iphone 5s, i can reach everything on the screen with my thumb. I am wondering about the future of Apple since the death of Steve Jobs though. They are involved with Dr Dre now and I heard they are going to make bigger phones, something Steve Jobs was against. Guess we will see. Gizmo trader took great care of me and the phone was described to a T down to a scratch on the corner......very good company and even better products I ordered this phone and it shows on the description that it is GSM unlocked. I activated SIM with Ultra mobile , its started working but data plan is not working , i called customer service they said that phone seems not be fully unlocked , Please let me know if any suggestion. Its a really cool mobile I love this phone - I am a big Apple fan but need a \\'real\\' keyboard. I probably would have bought an iPhone if I could get it with a keyboard. This phone is the perfect compromise - blends the best features of the Blackberry with the iPhone, and available unlocked to boot.3G works great, voice quality is excellent, battery life is FANTASTIC. I also love the form factor - the keyboard is nicely laid-out and well-sized, screen is very sharp, and the build quality is terrific. This phone is absolutely gorgeous, and extremely well-built.Also, Nokia\\'s free Mac syncing software does a great job of syncing with both iTunes and iPhoto for music, video and pictures. Has a nice PC suite as well (I sync it with my Windows laptop at work)Only downside is the camera - it\\'s OK, but despite the 3.2 MP pictures look grainy and the colors aren\\'t quite right. Rumor has it a firmware upgrade will fix that but haven\\'t heard for sure yet.If you\\'re considering the BlackBerry Bold or iPhone you should at least check this phone out as an alternative - for me it\\'s the perfect blend of the best features of both. I love this phone. I had it a few days and it works fine. The speed is good, the apps work fine. I haven\\'t worked all the functions yet but the only downfall that I have experience is the battery. When the phone is fully charged and I text a few people load in my contacts, surf the internet for 30 minutes or so, the battery goes low quickly. The cellphone does not connect to the LTE-4G network. It only works with 3G. The phone works well, but the glass on the front breaks very easily. After using an older smartphone for the past 4 years with no issues, it was quite surprising (and disappointing) to pull this one out of my pocket just a few days after I started using it and find that the front of the screen had a crack all the way through it. The phone still works, but the large crack across the screen makes me sad every time I see it. Works just fine. Love the larger numbers. A++ I throught the item was made bettrer then It look\\'s, the screen could be a little bigger then it is now. But I like the functions and the style the item. I ordered this since it is mentioned Unlocked. I ordered this to use outside US. Unfortunately 3G is not supported there so I\\'m stuck with this phone only having EDGE. My recommendation is, if anyone intention to use this outside US please check that country 3G bands and make sure it is matching with the one mentioned in this phone. (4G HSPA+ up to 21Mbps 850/1700/1900) So I\\'ve no use this phone now and can\\'t be returned also. My brother in law love it Great Phone. Great Camera. 💯👍🏽 Soy de venezuela el producto vino malo, lo mandee a reparar aqui y me dijeron que ya tenia varias reparaciones echas, y aqui los catalogaban como nuevo!! mal vendedor mal producto I\\'ve had it for about a month. I had no problems activating it with Verizon and it works like a new phone! I\\'m not an iPhone lover, but my daughter love it.so that\\'s fine with me. very good Unbelievable!!! Received phone and the previous owner never released it - SPRINT can\\'t set it up for us and keeps getting an error message because of it. Came in perfect condition with everything included 4,000 mah battery, 5.5 inch screen, android lollipop straight out of the box! What\\'s there not to like about this product? ..... I used the blu studio energy before this device I have to be honest to say this device is horrible in comparison to its predecessor....... Animations are more choppy...... Everyday tasks are not as smooth the ONLY thing that makes this phone worth it is the battery, I was actually impressed by the battery. When I first received my phone I charged to 100% and the first time I used it the device lasted about 2.5 days with heavy usage (screen all the way bright, games, shopping, youtube , Netflix etc.) The battery is a definitely something to brag about but this phone in general was just not for me. Hopefully in the future blu can increase the price a little bit more for a little better performance and screen quality Obviously it\\'s not a NEW phone. There are scratches on the screen. After 1 day, the battery still can not be 100% charged. I returned the phone. I\\'m very happy with this unlocked Galaxy S7. I like the size, excellent camera, good battery life. Would not go for the Edge model -- too large and expensive. Came with a UK type plug for the charger, but also an adapter for US outlets. Better if it were European/US, but it\\'s unlocked and great for travelers who carry a SIM for the countries they visit/live in. Way better if you have a Samsung, iPhone doesn\\'t work to great all you can do is call on it. Also my camera was crooked. excelente.. Very simple, very basic. Slow running with games. Battery: It charges slow (very slow), and discharges fast (really fast). The electrical is defective when I only using only two weeks. good Work well and doe exactly what I was looking for. Bought this for my dad on Father\\'s Day. He loved it and my mom did too! In fact she liked it so much she bought her own I was not impressed! Bought this phone and brought it to my phone store (Tmobile)...didn\\'t work with SIM card! A waste of time and money. Wrote review with phone it\\'s cool:) No sim card Better then I expected!!! :-) I bought this phone in June as my contract with my carrier was finished end of July and I\\'d be taking my business to an alternative carrier that allowed phones to be brought in independently.I literally activated and started using this phone 7/25/16. It is now 7/28/16 and here\\'s what I\\'ve discovered.1. The battery life is s***. From leaving my house at 10pm with 100% battery life, to checking my phone at 11:15pm, I was down to 85%. I hadn\\'t placed any calls, texts or used internet in an hour and fifteen minutes, but the life was down.2. It takes three to six tries to get a page to open in the Mini O (Internet). This is neither efficient or convenient to my usage.3. There\\'s only 4GB of Memory so I purchased a mini SD card of 32GB which I installed, but the phone kept interrupting me to let me know my internal memory was low, like every 30 seconds I had anything open. It\\'s like, yes I got it the first time.4. After shutting off my phone and plugging it in to charge, it no longer turns on. I checked the battery and even tried a different charger. No dice.This thing is basically a pretty paperweight at $73. it did not work well from the begining and the response from the seller is useless.Dear SirI had written to you earlier from INDIA over 3 months ago stating the problems I am having. Strangely you have not addressed my questions, the most important being whether what was sold to me was a new product as advertised. Instead of addressing questions clearly raised, you have chosen to side track and not respond to questions asked. This kind off attitude will certainly reflect very badly on a trusted site such as amazon. As stated earlier this phone did not work properly from the begining. Also one expect a minimum 1 year or atlest 6 month warranty on new products purchased from a trusted site like amazon.To state \"The return period for this device has expired\" without reason/explaining the return policy in the first place is very un-proffesional to say the least. Most dis-satisfied with the response received. Great phone. Great phone, great shipping Great phone, a lot better than the iPhone 4. very good phone I got this few days before Christmas and it came it right in time. The phone is nice and hardly any scratch or ding. My daughter loves it and she enjoy using it. So far everything lo0ks go0d, will update if there\\'s any concern on the phone, hopefully not. Simple phone with excellent battery life and perfect size... Excellent 3rd Posh phone. Overall excellent performance. Data connection is only 3G despite its claims and display of 4G. Battery life is not the best but will get you through the day for heavy users. This phone is an excellent choice, price for performance. I have had zero problems with the phone itself. I love Apple products and so far it stands up to any other I have had. The phone arrived sooner than expected, so as for the iPhone 6 it is a great device. I love my new phone. I get so many compliments and it looks and works great stopped working after 3 days had to send it back. could not even get it to turn on. I was so mad. Not a smartphone, yet pretty smartAfter my Nokia E51 came to an end, I started looking for a replacement that would best suite my needs. Taught by previous experiences, my aim was a larger screen unlocked phone equipped with GPS device, intuitive user interface, decent sync, email and tethering capabilities, W-LAN and a modern media player.After days of research, my choice came down to two models: Nokia N86 and Sony Ericsson W995a. Both feature excellent characteristics, and seem to perfectly meet my needs. At the end, the design weighted in favor of the SE.The phone comes in three flavors: Red, Progressive Black and Brushed Metal. I bought mine from Amazon, and they only had the Progressive Black Model. Note that my model\\'s name is W995a, which means that it supports frequencies across Americas, but rest reassured, it works in Europe and Asia as well on all networks, GSM and 3G.When you take it out of the box, it smells good, feels new and geeky :) Once you get to play with it, it feels solid in hand, and the sliding mechanism is excellent. The phone comes with an USB cable, wall charger, headphones, battery, printed and electronic documentation, and a generous 8GB memory card. Note that some operators in certain countries give you a set of plug-in stereo speakers, but those don\\'t come standard.It\\'s a slide form factor quad-band phone with 2.6\" display, 8.1 MP camera, kickstand, secondary video call camera, Sony Walkman with dedicated buttons, 3.5mm audio jack (thank you, Sony Ericsson, it was about the time) W-LAN, and loads of other features.At first, I found its buttons rather uncomfortable, for they are fairly flat and wide, and you need to operate them with you fingernails. The upper command buttons feel odd too, especially answer and hangup ones, for they are located at the very edge of the device. But it did not take me long to accommodate.The display is fairly large, showing crisp and clear images, and allowing various sizes of text to be displayed correctly. Its resolution of 320x240 pixels isn\\'t exactly the top of the class, neither is the color range of mere 256k. However, I ran a test with a .jpg image taken with my Nikon camera on Sony Ericsson W995 and Nokia E51, featuring 16M colors. Surprisingly enough, comparing side-by-side the two models, the W995 display proved to have more vibrant colors, and the overall impression of the image was by far better Nokia\\'s one.The phone comes with its own default animated and beautiful theme that goes great with its design. If you prefer the classic Sony Ericsson looks, you can switch back at any time, though the selection of themes that comes pre-installed is poor.Experience of browsing through menus, writing messages and making calls is ok, even though the interface sometimes lacks responsiveness due to animated themes and quantity of contents.Furthermore, W995 comes with tons of apps and features you easily get used to and never want to leave behind. For example, pedometer, accelerometer, shake control, location service, and many great solutions that exploit this hardware make this device a very versatile must-have multi purpose pocket device you always want to carry around. Less known goodies of this products are the camera flash that can be used either as torch or as SOS signaling device, and the USB battery charging capability. The last one is particularly useful when you say tether it with a computer to go online. This normally drains your battery very quickly, but in the case of W-series, your battery is being recharged instead of consumed. And when you press the +/- volume button in standby mode, it displays a clock with some basic information across the entire screen. Additionally, the phone comes filled with cool games that are great for killing time on airports :) and a coupon for a free download of 100 Sony production songs.What I particularly liked about this phone is the ease of tethering with any major OS platforms out there. I\\'ve tested it on a Mac (Snow Leopard 10.6) and Windows XP Professional, and it worked like a charm. With W995, using your phone as a GSM or 3G modem is no longer a nightmare. The functionality is built right in, and when you connect it to any computer via an USB cable, you get prompted to choose amongst the fallowing: use your phone as modem, mass storage, file transfer, sync or PC suite.Viewing / listening to media content is an amazing experience. The interface is easy and intuitive thanks to dedicated buttons, and the sound quality is unprecedented. However, getting your contents to your phone is another pair of shoes.While the PC suite is an excellent peace of work, the software for Mac looks and feels poor. It all seems like sugar and cream for you PC guys out there, but what about us, the Mac users? Well, it\\'s not that we\\'re not taken into consideration, far from that. However, serious improvements are yet to be made issuing Mac-Sony Ericsson friendship. What you get on the Sony Ericsson web site is an iSync plugin (available only recently), allowing you to sync your contacts, tasks, and calendars between W995 and your Mac. And MediaSync, which is, or should be, the equivalent of MediaGo. The truth is, it allows you to transfer music and podcasts, but not the videos. Kind of sad. The good side is that it works well with iTunes library, and manages your music and podcasts flawlessly. Yet transferring videos between a Mac and your W995 still remains an issue. There are ways around, but they don\\'t always work.On the iSync level, things are not shining either. With the older version of iSync plugin, the synchronizing process was fairly time consuming since it was not incremental. That means that every time you want to synchronize your contacts, tasks and calendars, it completely replaces the entire content. This was soon fixed by an updated plugin, so now it takes far less time. Furthermore, it crippled my address book since the two databases are still far from compatible.However, this all shows that Sony Ericsson is still pioneering in the Mac compatibility field, and hopefully these issues will be addressed in the upcoming versions of firmware. What I do like about the Sony Ericsson bluetooth syncing is that you can enable it to always accept demands from known devices. That way you no longer have to frenetically look for your device (pocket? desk? handbag? quick!), each time iSync starts. Just make sure it\\'s within the bluetooth range, and you\\'re in sync, with no annoying dialogues around.Another annoying thing about this product is the lack of support for certain character formats. So when you receive an email written in say croatian keyboard layout, instead of the actual content, it displays a \"unknown character set\" message. So it\\'s clear to see that W995 is still pretty much an unfinished product, from the firmware developing standpoint.And now to camera! I had no special demands on my phone\\'s camera, so I completely forgot about it. But when I got to play with it, I found that it\\'s not bad at all. In fact, it\\'s a 8,1MP camera with autofocus, flash, face and smile recognition, and loads of other features from the k-series! And the picture quality is awesome! Holy cow! The down side is that the picture quality suffers dramatically in low light conditions: the colors fade or go crazy, contours mix up, and a huge amount of noise takes away all the pleasure. So you can either try to save it in an image editing software or just be honest and conclude that the pic sucks. Up to you :)So the bottom line is: shot on sun, and keep the good impression. Another interesting thing about the camera is a dedicated shutter button. Very nice feature. However, it can also be a problem at times. You see, when you want to take a picture, first you need to press the shutter button halfway down, to allow the autofocus to find objects you presumably want to sharpen up. The process takes up to 5 seconds, after which you get this annoying beep, meaning: Now you can press the button all the way down. Yeah, right. Your object is by than far away from the frame, the kids are no longer smiling, and the dog just knocked off chasing his tale. This can be particularly annoying when asking someone to take a picture of you.Last but not the least: the build quality. Though the phone is solid and feels expensive, my recommendation is to pay attention to scratches and bruises. The chassis is extremely sensitive to scratches, and I recommend buying a screen cover and a some kind of protective case right away. The Sony Ericsson logo is subject to damage as well as the \"W995\" sign, since both are no other but stickers and tend to peel off with the time.All in all, an excellent phone, but the competition in its price range is stiff. Some software issues remain loose ends, but they\\'ll probably get ironed up.the GOOD:-features (big)-camera (despite all the odds)-3.5 audio jack-unprecedented media experience-usb charged battery-intuitive interface-DLNA (haven\\'t tested it though)-sliding mechanism-attention to detailsthe BAD-poor Mac compatibility-poor build quality of the chassis-lack of character support for many languages in default email app-kickstand feels clumsy-WLAN doesn\\'t work in some hotspots-lack of search storage capability-browsing through address book feels like the year 2000-other small imperfections in firmware Good phone for the value. You cannot beat the price for unlocked phone. I am using this phone once I travel overseas. The quality and speed of the phone is good. It works perfectly and delivery was fast. Love the phone received it on May 16th and now it will not charge unless the charging cord is rigged in some kind of way and I know it\\'s the charging port bc I have tried 7 different charging cords and 4 different charger wall plugs. And since Friday has been shutting itself off and on several times throughout the day. So aggravating I bought this phone 2 months after having bought blu life one for the first time and the screen shattered completely so I\\'ve bought 2 phones in the past 6 months. Excellent phone and it works great with 3G Movistar in Venezuela, initially thought that the phone came locked for use only in Europe but putting on my sim card worked perfectly Movistar Received this the last week of July \\'16. The phone arrived right before our 2 week vacation so I took it for a spin using the GPS. I had a little better luck with MapQuest then with Google Maps, but in both cases I\\'ve had issues with the GPS staying active. If I pre-program it prior to leaving and don\\'t press start right away, it doesn\\'t seem like it is working when I press start and start driving. I\\'ve had to restart the phone several times to get it to activate.I love the fact that the radio works. Wifi, which gets used almost daily, has been awesome. Google voice and Youtube work as they should.Still getting used to the size. Would have preferred a 4\" with Lollipop. Hard to fit in the pocket.. Also still getting used to talking on the phone.The battery, which is 3000 mAh, seems to get eaten through pretty fast when the screen is on. Other than that, no issues. excellent item i love it Bought this for my mom and she loves it. She has no complaints so a good buy overall Phone sold as new was clearly used. It came shrinkwrapped in branded packaging, however, the phone lacked protective coverings as seen clearly in any in boxing video. Upon turning the phone on there was noticable light bleed down the left hand side of the screen as it was delaminating or not seated properly. There were also dead pixels and a very noticeable light spiderwebbing underneath the glass, kind of as if it had been dropped and the LCD was damaged. Upon the first boot up, I pressed the square navigation key and was met with several programs I did not launch. One of these was the camera app which clearly showed the face of another person in there room. This phone was clearly used and damaged by the previous owner. The deception of re shrinkwrapping the box and representing it as new is not only unappreciated by a buyer spending nearly $300 on an item, but very lazy also, as it\\'s condition was not passable in the slightest. wow super purchase...all my six phones are unlocked and truly GSM unlocked.great thanks guys. Bought this for my nephew as a \"mini tablet\" to use on airplane mode so he could watch YouTube and play his games. Runs minecraft pe and goat simulator without lag. It came with a screen protector and a silicone case not too shabby. Amazing phone!! Great camera and so fast. I never have issues with it!! I absolutely love this phone! I use this as a media device while working out, so I don\\'t know how it functions as an actual phone. I think if I were using it as a phone... actually there\\'s no way I\\'d use this for a phone. I\\'d go crazy. But then I have a giant phablet and love it for playing games and reading ebooks. But the things that make it great for that make it horrible for working out, which is why I went looking for something small and inexpensive to use at the gym.This phone fits the bill fantastically! I would have gone 4.5 stars if that was an option. The only real downside is the keyboard. Like the other reviews said, it is absolutely ridiculous. I didn\\'t think it could be as bad as they said, but they\\'re not exaggerating; it\\'s nearly impossible to use, even with a stylus. I don\\'t have large fingers and generally don\\'t have problems with keyboards. Getting signed into android and the few apps I wanted to use it for took far too long and made me want to throw the darn thing across the room. I downloaded the free trial of swype and that helped a little, but there\\'s really only so much you can do when you\\'re working with a screen that small.But now that I\\'m signed in and set up, it\\'s great! I\\'ve been using it for a week or so now, and it\\'s everything I\\'d hoped it could be! It\\'s small and relatively flat, and it fits in the pocket of my running shorts designed for keys. The apps i needed work just fine, as does the WiFi and the Bluetooth for my headphones. The lack of app drawer was odd but since I don\\'t use it for much other than a few apps, I just put the ones I need on the home screen and don\\'t really have to mess with the others. Things are kinda slow to open, but that\\'s understandable because, again, I\\'m comparing to a much more powerful phone. And once they open, they work just fine.If you\\'re looking for a media device with Wifi and Bluetooth that\\'s small enough to fit in those tiny little key pockets built into running shorts, this is perfect! The team came with a ripping the home button , the return was done . The phone had warranty so I was able to replace it several times with Apple, However the fact that I replaced it so much was annoying.I used this Phone with H20 but you don\\'t get Pic Messages only with iMessage, I used Page Plus the coverage was decent in my area. I used it with Verizon and overall the prepaid Verizon Coverage is decent. However the fact that I had to replace the phone through Apple several times was annoying but I appreciated having the ability to do so with the 1 year Warranty good product a+++++++++ I like the dimensions of this cell, but the very low capacity of his sistem make I dislike it. Canot install apps, or games or anything else cause it don\\'t have enough space to store this things, so I need to use it on basics functions and apps.... Bought this phone for my mom. She didn\\'t need a sophisticated, high-tech phone. This was simple, a good size for her, compatible with T-Mobile high speed data, and you can download your regular apps from the playstore. Only downside is poor battery life. Excelente producto Love love love it. I just love my phone. It does what it says. Excellent battery life. While everyone else is scrambling to plug their phones in, Im letting them borrow my charger cause I just don\\'t usually need it.lol Excelente product and excelent supplier. Timely delivery. Product according to the specifications. excelent quality-price relation, easy to use. Wifi very useful Excelent camera. I strongly recommend it. The phone was not working at all. I had to return it and now I need to find me a good Samsung galaxy. Be careful when you order. Still going strong! bought it for my wife. She dropped it in the toilet and we cleaned it up with alcohol and sticking it in rice. The dual sim is a cool feature but you have to set up everything each time. We use it for the BVI between the USVI and the VPN has to be put in now and then Looks new, no scratches are all, I recommend This phone is really good. I was looking for an upgrade from a previous android phone. Am glad i purchased this one. The camera\\'s are amazing\\' I was pleasantly surprised at how clean the pics are. The only downside is that the headphone is at the bottom but I could live with it. I would recommend this phone. Nb this is the 2015 version. It\\'s battery life is great. It\\'s very responsive to touch. The only issue is that sometimes the screen goes black and you have to press the top button several times to get the screen to re-illuminate. I bought this device for my 16 year old nephew, so far no complains everything works as described, it was shipped in a timing matter and the packaging was secured Es perfecto. I want to thank Amazon and the people that sells things on Amazon. when my co-worker told me I can find a lot of good stuff on amazon.com for cheap I was skeptical because I really don\\'t like to shop on line and especially I don\\'t like using my debit card online plus I thought I was going to be disappointed. so as soon as I got home I went on amazon.com and saw the iphone that my son wanted and I didn\\'t have to spend that much for it. he needs it for school and his birthday is coming up so he\\'s happy and i\\'m happy...thanks again Amazon!! Taliah. excelente ok This phone is absoulutly perfect and everything i hoped it would be for my boyfriend he cant wait to use it!!! Shipping was a little late but that wasnt there fault 😊😊😊😊😊 amazing phone id deffinitly recomend this!! The unlocked iphone works great internationally. I purchase it for a 2-yr assignment in Brazil and have to say it worked well, never had an issue. Good backup phone Bought this for my parents who were reluctant to try a smartphone when their razr stopped working on their provider. Didn\\'t work. Gave 3 stars because the seller tried to make it right but the second didn\\'t work either. Oh well, I tried. Still working My daughter was very pleased with it. A truly unlocked phone. I charged it and it was ready to go. It is no iphone, but for those who would like to be introduced to the Blackberry user interface, this is your phone. I placed two orders one for LG CU920 and LGCU720 and paid for new phones but when delivered were refurbished thing that indicate as refurbished because I chat with an LG rep and based upon my info on these products about their functionality he told me they are refurbished. Instruction books were not original instead photocopied and top of that was black and white print. Cannot transfer files from a webpage. Ringtone so low hardly can be heard in an open area due to which I missed several calls. Therefore clearly to mention that in these product I was totally mislead, charged money for new product but delivered refurbished ones. So please customers when ordering any unlock cell phone make sure they are delivered new, if for any reason you are hinted that it is refurbished or used one please return it immediately without hasel. I received the phone in good condition I love the phone have to get use to it. it seems like good phone with dual sim color is neon pink love it. Recommendee for y\\'all androids user the phone is everything i expected and more its look is almost brand new everything is working no complain... its an awesome phone .... value is greater than the price... Works well for a disposable cheep phone. Somewhat difficult to use as menu structure not orginized well. Audio volume and quality poor. Yes this iPhone is amazing and I absolutely love it it\\'s frozen on me once but all I had to do was restart it over all great phone and long lasting battery This is a great product and works as expected. I am impressed at how easy it was to switch over to my active verizion account. Thank you for backing your product. First things first, this is not a bad phone by any means. I like the design where the buttons are all on the back of the smartphone, its very unique. The phone is fast and snappy, i had no big problems with it when it came in. The box was a little torn up when it came in, but that is not a big problem to me. the battery life on the phones has not perform so well although it has a 3000mAh battery. I think overtime it will get better. One bad thing about this phone is the screen quality. I don\\'t know if my phone is defected or not, but it seems that every time that i would press hard on the screen, there appear to be pressure creating a blurry white circle on the screen. it\\'s not really a big problem since I don\\'t press phone screens hard, usually. But, it does get annoying when you are playing games and pressing down hard at the screen which creates that blurry white circle. Everything else about this phone is flawless. One more thing, the lg ui sucks, but i downloaded nova launcher which is a million times better. bien I bought three unlocked smartphones (on Amazon) to use and evaluate: Samsung Galaxy 4, Nokia 920, and Blackberry 9930. After six months experience, here are my thoughts.I have relied heavily on my PC and a dumb cell phone for more than 20 years, but I finally decided to get a smartphone.As a user I like the Samsung least in terms of its user interface and focus on advertising stuff. The Nokia 920 has a brilliant screen and the best graphics for games and movies. But as a communicator, the BB 9930 is the best!To quote a line from the movie Star Wars regarding the Millennium Falcon, \"it\\'s got it where it counts\". If your focus for a phone is (1) phone calls, (2), SMS, and (3) email, then Blackberry 9930 (also 9900) is the best. Virtually no advertising fluff is imposed on the user.As I said, I wanted a phone, first and foremost. However, you might be interested to know that it is also a brilliant MP3 player.Here is some other information which I hope some readers find helpful.P. S. My service provider is Telna, which I have used for years. Their pay-as-you-go, no-subscription-contract (for voice, SMS, and data) is brilliantly cost-effective! Their GSM sim card interfaces perfectly in the Blackberry 9900/9930.P. P. S. I read the reviews of some users who have encountered SETUP PROBLEMS. As I said above, I have an unlocked Blackberry 9930, an unlocked Nokia 920 and an unlocked Samsung Galaxy 4, all purchased from Amazon. Please be aware that all unlocked phones have setup challenges that will be \"learning curve\" for the new buyer. Here is some help for the BB 9930/9900.I believe most of my comments below would apply to 9900, but please be aware that the 9900 does not support CDMA; the 9930 is both GSM and CDMA capable.If you are getting the \"ACTIVATION REQUIRED\" message at the top of a Verizon BB 9930 that is supposed to unlocked, the message is misleading. I eliminated this message as follows.There is a CDMA screen for the 9930. You can access it by dialing ##000000 from your Blackberry 9930, which will take you to the \"CDMA Service Edit Screen\", where you can edit some settings.Edit the \"Mobile Directory Number\" there (it may be blank or the some vestigial Verizon phone number) and enter your phone number that you are using with your SIM card. This eliminates the \"Activation Required\" heading at the top. Be careful not to change anything else on this screen.INTERNET BROWSING is accomplished as follows.First, you must specify your APN for your service provider. My service provider is Telna, and their service is very cost competitive and works very well with the BB 9930.Goto to \\'Options\\' on the Home screen.Goto to \\'Device\\'.Goto to \\'Advanced System Settings\\'.Goto to \\'TCP IP\\'.Enable \"APN Settings\".Specify \"APN: \" with the URL from your service provider.In my case I did not check \"APN Authentication Enabled:\".You probably should leave blank \"Username for APN:\" and \"password for APN:\"Browsing the internet works quite well as follows:(1) Use the native BB browser for web access via wifi; the BB browser will refuse to connect over GSM.(2) Use Opera Mini for web access over GSM; Opera Mini will refuse to connect over wifi. Install app \"Opera Mini\" as a browser using \"Blackberry World\". Note, you must be connected by wifi to use \"Blackberry World\". Search for and install \"Opera Mini\".(3) To minimize data charges, I keep \"Data Services\" turned off. I turn it on only when I want Opera Mini to use GSM, and incur data charges. From the Home screen, goto \"Manage Connections\", \"Network and Connections\", \"Mobile Network\", and adjust the setting for \"Data Services\".BLACKBERRY 9930 MANUALThe online manual is excellent. Search forBlackberry 9930 \"User Guide\" .If you read this far, I hope it was helpful. Love it. Excellent This phone is got for a friend and he loves it!! I am super happy that I got the Samsung S5. I got it about 1 month ago from SCE Enterprise.I picked it for its camera, and I have been continuously impressed at the resolution. The system provides various special features, e.g. video stabilization, burst shots, face detection, and then the usual, white balance, ISO, exposure value. The front facing camera is useful, good enough to skype.The processor is fast, turning it on and off takes about 30 seconds. I downloaded ~25 apps, and it runs fine.The speakers are not very loud, not enough for me to sing along during a shower.The charging portal is not a conventional one, which is unpleasant because I need to buy several more. And if I forget one when I am away from home, my friends won\\'t have extras.The battery life is pretty low, maybe 1 percentage decrease per 1.5 minutes. If I am watching something 3 hours straight, it would be dead. Overnight, it goes down about 12 % just on standby. The battery is a regular Samsung battery.I am on an AT&T plan, and the phone adjusted smoothly. I had to go to the store to exchange for a smaller SIM card, which took about 30 minutes. The only bump was when my data didn\\'t work due to an old APN. So, I added a new one for ATT and it works fine now.Overall, I am super pleased. The LG G4 is a great smartphone, but you shouldn\\'t buy this model. This is the US991 version, and it\\'s just terrible. It comes on the latest android 6 version, witch is just a complete battery sucker, and the US991 version can\\'t be downgraded. You could do some adjustments in case you have root access to lower do battery consume of this android version, but you can\\'t unlock bootloader on the freaking US991 LG G4, so you can\\'t root as well. Bottom line, don\\'t by this model of the phone, go for the H815 instead. You can never make through the day with this US991 version, and you will get avrg 2 hours and 30 minutes of screen on time at best. Returned the product due to it appeared to have been opened and or used a bit. If it was not used the packaging and phone seem to had a bit of rough treatment. The feel of the phone didn\\'t \\'feel\\' very high quality either. This is a cute uograded phone from my samsung note 2. Slimmer and sleek too. I had to buy another one for my mum...Price was ok A=AT&T; T=Tmobile etc. Although it\\'s unlocked, and both Tmobile and ATT use GSM and this is a GSM phone, not everything that is usable on AT&T may be useable on Tmobile. I am finding this out the hard way with hours and hours of calls with Samsung, Tmobile, etc. I love this phone. A few of my close friends and family saw it liked it. The features and the price a big sell. Very quick! Have so many scratches. I think it was not in good condition. But it works great. Nice phone, easy to setup, and brilliant quality. I love the 8MP camera. It was better than my Android, and I know that\\'s for sure. I took the phone to AT&T, had it activated, and TA-DA!Pros:*Excellent 8MP rear camera with an awesome 1.2MP FaceTime camera*Very responsive touchscreen with absolutely no lags*Easy to transfer Android items to iPhone( if you are a previous Android user)Cons:*Slippery plastic back but easily fixed if you buy a case Awesome phone. Screen is in perfect condition. Item is exactly what is posted. Very happy..I would recommend the seller again. Excellent Did not work! What a great phone for the price. I have a small business and use Office 365. I previously had a very cheap flip phone for my business phone line, with cheap $10 a month voice service from PureTalk USA. I wanted a windows phone so that I could more easily store and synchronize my contacts with my Office 365 service. I figure that for $80, this phone would at least do the minimum for me. I am pleasantly surprised. I just popped my PureTalk sim card into the phone, set up wireless, and I was in business. It now synchronizes everything I need on the phone and when I\\'m near some free wireless or at home, I can use the data services.This is a great low-budget way of having a business phone for $10 a month with no contract and no outrageous $600 phone.The phone itself is snappy and responsive. It came with a charger, USB cable, pair of earbuds, clear rubber protector, and an extra screen protector, in addition to the one already on the phone out of the box. I paired my bluetooth headset, and I\\'m ready for business. This is the second case I purchase and none fit. Am so dissapointed Good I received the phone and it appears to be unlocked but the reception is so poor I cannot place calls without them dropping. The phone also is rebooting during calls. I tried to contact the seller and if I want to exchange the phone I need to ship it back on my own.Definitely go with another phone. Recieved the brand new phone only to find out the hard way that no micro sim inserted into the sim card slot works at all. I Get the message No Sim Card-Emergency calls only. My service provider tried every micro sim they had and none worked. I even tried my sisters micro sim.AV House is the seller by the way. Please do not buy anything from these people. returned phone. did not meet requirements i wanted. great basic phone for whatsapp instagram messenger twitter facebook etr I bought it like \"New\" but it is not. It is refurbished and it suddenly stopped working The product is bad and faulty. Currently not working. I am disappointed.I see that Sept 5th was the deadline for return but that is unfortunate. I bought for my sister in africa and sent it to her. It didnt reach her until 20th of September, only to find out that the item is faulty and not in fair working condition I recently ordered a Blackberry Gemini 8520 unlocked gsm phone for use internationally. When I recieved said order, it in fact was not a Gemini 8520, but a Blackberry Curve; of which I think may have been re-furbished. I didn\\'t want the hassle of returning the Curve because I need to use a phone immediately. So I did not complain until I was asked to write a review of this item.Thanks! Ok i got it today, but i have a worry, my question is , is it open for any sim card from any country? Coz i want to send it to cameroon to a cousin. Please let me knowso i can order more EXCELLENT PRODUCT, GOOD CARE OF SELLER. I RECOMMEND 100% An amazing phone. Highly intuitive. Super fast. Excellent internal memory which can be expanded. Lovely reception when talking. It has a great feel in hands - light, almost seems to conform to your palms as well - despite the size. I love it and the Smart features are really cool. Overall I really love the phone. Great value in my opinion. Keeper for a long time Fancy Good nice for its price I request and pay for a white one and I finally get one in black, that I found wrong in the phone . Does what is says but it is a clunky big watch All good Do not recommend. The publication was saying that the phone was new and not new, was already used and had stuck a protective film on the screen, and original plastic did not. Arrived quickly and as advertised! A+ transaction, highly recommended Bought 4. All of them came with supiciuos preinstalled glass protection. One of them for each family member (wife, me and sons). I came to the Z3+ in order to have all of my chargers standarized. My Z3 were a complete frustration about the magnetic conector (2 of them failed), but I still liked Sony for having a nice Android implementation. Also wanted to be conected with all my family during my stay in USA, so i decided for dual sim version. Two phones of the four I have bought have the touchscreen broken. I have realized of that as one of them stopped working properly after twoo weeks. In the past one dual sim Z3 supiciusly failed after trying to get photos of my daghter in the pool. Now, I have lose all confidence in dual sim versions selled on AMAZON with \"no warranty\". In the last twoo years 4 of the six phones I have bought failed (twoo Z3 and twoo Z3+). This has triggered the wish to move all family to iphones next year.Update: 3 of 4 Z3+ hace touchscreen broken! Not what I expected good No problems. It is a REALLY NICE android phone! It has the most advanced Google features. The phone doesn\\'t come with any pre-installed apps, which is great! Because I never use the pre-installed apps in my old android phones. I really like all the Google apps that the phone provides. The camera is also very nice. The Do not disturb feature in the phone is better than any other phone I had. This is a great phone!! Great phone at a great price Good replacement part Very good Its not unlocked can t use all the feature volume poor quality wish i can return it Love the Phone. Thanks it\\'s an iPhone Recieved certified refurbished phone genuine samsung charger and cord + new headphones and ear buds....but it would not register on T-mobile network because the \"Seller/previous owner \" had an unpaid balance on the phone! excellent the home key is not work!!the home key is not work!!the home key is not work!!how can i do? Perfect. Delivered early. No problems whatsoever. Very reliable. Very user friendly , you can download skyfire and watch video with flash. The middle button works like a mouse and the ovi maps work great.It comes in handy when you are somewhere and you don\\'t have a gps. It will give you a sense of security. There is nothing on the market that has that much function and still made out of stainless steel and its super thin. Only bad thing is that it doesn\\'t have touchscreen, but oh well for what it is its a great phone. I recommend this phone. This phone replaced a Nexus 5 that suffered a cracked screen, so this review is based on my previous use of the N-5. Overall, I like the 5X. The battery lasts longer than the 5\\'s did, and the picture quality of the 5X camera is visibly better than the 5\\'s. Also, the fingerprint recognition feature is VERY convenient. Most other performance is very similar to the N-5.What does bother me about the phone is the feel in my hand. The larger size, combined with a slimmer profile and lighter weight makes it feel like I\\'m going to drop the phone all the time. The side and back finish of the phone is supposed to be a soft-feel material for better gripping, but mine always feels somewhat slippery (I don\\'t keep my phone in a case). Makes my buttons on my phone sluggish:( Don\\'t advice anyone to buy it. Doesn\\'t even charge I bought this Samsung behold and after using it for about a year, it freezes up. I can\\'t make call or view anything on the phone, it\\'s useless now and waited my money. excellent product. I have been an Android fan for a number of years, and this time I decided to give Asus a try, leaving Samsung Galaxy aside for the time being. There were two main arguments in favor of my change: in the first place, my previous experience with Asus (a very good notebook years ago) and, in the second place, a very reasonable price, when comparing it with other much more expensive phones with similar characteristics. Up to now, the Asus ZenFone 3 ZE552KL 64 GB has met all my expectations, always responding to the demands I make from it. Furthermore, the phone has excelled regarding battery life.I must admit that I was quite worried for a moment when, after opening the box on arrival, I found that the tiny user\\'s guide was written only in Chinese and that, upon turning the phone on, all text on it was also in Chinese! Fortunately for me, it was easy to change the language to English and to download an excellent user\\'s guide in English. Things went smoothly after that.One final comment: I frequently interchange English and Spanish when texting. The Asus Zen UI Keyboard has proven excellent, and going from one language to the other is extremely easy. In addition to that, voice typing is absolutely wonderful. (I must say, however, that I do not know if this trait is to be ascribed to the Asus ZenFone itself, or if its merits are to be ascribed to the Android 6.0.1 version.) It\\'s totally not the same like the one I bought many years ago from Sony store. This does not look like a real phone. El telefono me llego el dia pautado. Al abrirlo me fijo que el vidrio que protege la camara no lo trajo,le coloque la bateria para ver si todo estaba funcionando correctamente pero para mi sorpresa la bateria vino dañada. Lo lleve a un sitio a que le dieran lo q llaman un choque a la baeria a ver si era que estaba muy descargada pero no funciono. Tuve que comprarle una. al llegar a mi casa, espere que se descargara la bateria para realizar la primera carga y al conectar el cargador me lleve una segunda sorpresa pues el cargador tampoco sirvio. Tuve que comprarle un cargador nuevo. Luego de un mes comienzo a darme cuenta que la trackpad comenzo a quedarse pegada asi que lo lleve a un sitio especializado a cambiarsela cuando se supone que debe durar mucho tiempo. Pero al pasar unos dias con la nueva trackpad me doy cuenta que se sigue pegando y lo vuelvo a llevar con un especialista en blackberry y al agarrarlo no solo me dijo que tiene algo mas dañado sino que el telefono esta reconstruido y yo lo compre como un telefono nuevo. Tengo unos 2 meses con el telefono y no solo pague por el costo del telefono sino por la bateria nueva, el cargador nuevo, tracpad nuevo y de paso ya comenzo a apagarse. Por eso solo le coloque una estrella. Me estafo totalmente!! It came in excellent condition, works well with metro pcs Worst phone I have ever owned. I bought this on July16 and the phone stopped working this morning. I should have realized it was horrible when it would not hold a charge and now it won\\'t charge at all. My phone is completely dead and use able. Now I have to buy a new phone because in my job I cannot be without a phone. My customer and staff cannot get in touch with me. DO NOT buy this phone. It\\'s junk for the price it is a good mobile. IT is very good This watch is amazing. Technology can\\'t get better than this. My son loves it. Great seller, thanks for the phone! It\\'s a real pretty phone I just don\\'t think you can use this phone with T-mobile Great phone for the price. The phone works Ok. I thought I had a problem with the phone, it was the sim card. I was just about to return it but change my mind. Everything as expected. Love my S5 mini. Beautiful phone, works great! Bought Phone For My Mom She Loves It Great Buy First One Didn\\'t Work Seller Sent Me Another One The Second One Work great Wonderful, amazing product. Love it Brand new without a original case. It say UNLOCKED,But it is LOCKED and could not be used in my country :( :( I just bought this.phone less than a month ago and it already has stopped working. You. Can\\'t download anything with a SD card. Very good! The battery is completely fried and won\\'t hold a charge for very long. I don\\'t like this Pocket PC. Everything works, but its so slow... I allways close unnecesary opened applications, but it still slow. It seems to me that HP have to work on using a new processor, something about double the actual speed of 416 Mhz. Here are some observations:1. The phone works, just put your SIM card and use it, thats ok. The problem is that the software and response time never compares with my previous Sony Ericsson phones, my last one was a W600i. You need both hands to operate it, if you are driving... looking for a phone number in contacts, Call History or the Speed Dial, be careful, use your Pocket PC phone can easily kill you... of course you can use a voice activation software that in my case, Latin America, almost none of the automatic softwares works (accent I guess). If I\\'m dialing a number and the voice mail alert starts playing right before the recorder starts... it doesn\\'t matter if you press the End button, buttons are so slow in response that you have no time to place a miss call...2. The GPS works just fine, but not with the HP applications... there are no maps for my country (Panama)I used the GPS Tuner software and had to georeference some images from google earth.3. The HP 6945 freezes a lot, it is very anoying having to restard so often. Some times it freezes when I\\'m receiving a call.4. The square screen is not good because some of my applications don\\'t work on it.5. The camera is really slow to start, very limited functionality and bad quality photos... if you want to waste good moments... just go and take pictures with this mediocre camera.6. The battery is very bad, you better keep on syncronizing very often or you\\'ll end up with out batteries very soon. There a lot of excuses like don\\'t use your Blue tooth to often, dont use your GPS because it\\'ll suck your battery, pay 55$ for a new bulky battery, stuf like that.7. I\\'m not planning to buy other HP Pocket PC in the future, I\\'m so frustrated with this one. It seems that most of these unlocked international version phones are unlocked by the sellers themselves, who break the phone\\'s box seal, open the box, and unlock the phones themselves (note that Samsung says \"do not accept if seal is broken\"). Hence, technically, most of these unlocked international version phones are not really new. I bought a lot of Samsung Galaxy S7 Edge phones from Amazon, and most (not all) had the seal broken.On the phone itself, this is the best phone I have ever tried. Slick, light, balanced, fantastic screen, fast, water proof, and so on .... its only caveat (and an important one) is the lack of removable battery (Samsung lost the removable batter starting with the S6). I like this phone much better than the Edge. The S7 Edge has a bigger screen, but the resolution is the same as with the S7, and its edges are highly annoying, making one touch them by mistake constantly. Furthermore, the Edge\\'s edges make it very difficult to properly protect the phone with a case - not a problem with the regular S7.Finally, the only difference between the G930F (single sim version) and the G930FD (dual sim version) is that in the latter the slot where the micro card goes is also enabled to accept a second sim card, which is recognized by the device\\'s OS. For what it is i guess it has it\\'s good features, but it won\\'t send or receive multimedia texts. the screen is very small and the images are not that clear. the Flashlight is cool and the battery life is great. I wouldn\\'t buy it again though. DO NOT buy this phone! You will find countless reports of this \"flagship device\" falling to the Boot-Loop defect online. LG has acknowledged the issue and claims they will repair affected phones in 7-9 business days IF you have a warranty. Without a warranty, you are buying a defective phone that will make a nice paper weight in six months. verey good thank you Device was as described, arrived quickly and has been working like a charm over the last several months that I\\'ve had it. Very pleased. Doesn\\'t like the washing machine at all! The phone works fine but it\\'s not possible to set it in Spanish, it only can be set in English or Asian languages. I dislike the blu phone Amazing phone Is NOT unlocked! I had second thoughts on a Refurbished product, but worked perfectly with no problems. Totally Recommended, just have in mind that the box is not the original box. Perfect Mobile , I found what I want and more the speed , its camera , the application all are very goodThe seller is is perfect also. I can say this mobile is better than others include iPhone 6 In almost perfect shape (some light wear on the battery cover, nothing that you can see very clearly). Happy with the phone. No sound quality problems as others have reported. Great for those searching for a basic phone. No internet, no camera, bigger lettering. Amazing value Got it early and love it just what i needed I\\'ve tried Samsung, HTC, Motorola and this Sony is by far the most superior phone I\\'ve ever had. This model is mid range ,I can\\'t imagin what a top of the line Sony would be like.Xperia fan for life Greay ok I LOVE this phone! I\\'m not a big cell phone gamer, nor do I use my cell phone as a photo storage device. I use only the basic functions of the cell phone, phone calls, texts, facebook, sometimes skype, some browsing... this phone provides everything I need and the speed is amazing! The finger print feature is pretty interesting. I also like the camera a lot! Product was received as described and it worked perfectly Lots of great features, and even though it flips 2 ways, it is durable.Young teens tend to be a little tough on phones. At least in our experience.Our Daughter is thrilled! great little phone camera on the front is just as good as the back too better that the studio x and xplus that ive bought, its a keeper Not a good buy for me, have to return it to Amazon. I tried buying a TMobile or ATT sim card on line and after entering the IMEI number received the message that the IMEI isn\\'t valid and that the device is unusable and I should buy another device. I like the cell good settings ASUS really highly recommend this phone in all aspects now tell you JUST I FOUND THE BAD OF THIS PHONE IS THE battery is a little hard crap 6-7 hours if you use a lot the internet is consumed as a car 12 CYLINDER CONSUME GAS is amazing REDUCE ONE percent every 10 minutes or so I have just one month in and I already sell SOON , pay attention to the BATTERY is not good quality VERY BAD DO NOT HOLD THE CHARGE REALLY I DO not recommend this phone, thanks Very good! Thanks I like it Not much to say. It is exactly what the description says it is. Worked with 4 different carriers in 2 different countries. I love it Great phone. Camera lacks a little, speaker lacks a little. But your paying very little for what you get. A++ It\\'s fast, the battery life it\\'s good for me (almost 2 days or more) and i love the camera.The whatsapp have some problems but it\\'s not a phone trouble for sure This one is my wife\\'s. For overall use, loves it. But she really wanted an improved camera and video over our previous Lumia phones.Yes, camera has better resolution. BUT....audio recording gets blasted out in loud environments, which the Nokia did not. So...meets the needs for talk/text/apps...does not for her quality pictures and video under certain conditions. Probably better than average for it\\'s price point. The best or nothing :)) Fine, that\\'s what I am waiting for Great! I love it! Love my LG G2 The phone works fine and great but I have a big question. Will it ever upgrade to marshmallow 6.1? My second cell phone with Android System and it is good for its price SELLER IS LYING ABOUT WARRANTY. PHONES ARE SOLD PAST WARRANTY. You will not be able to get any help from the manufacturer, and they will charge you at least $40 just to take a look if anything should go wrong. Many comments show the phone consistently has problems 3-6 months past purchase.I ordered this phone February of 2012. It initially functioned fine, though the cosmetics (plastics on the surface, colored designs &c) came off within a few weeks. I had trouble with the charger within a month of ordering - it did not fit snugly into the phone but buying another USB chrarger solved the problem.After 3 months, the phone has started to reboot constantly and always reverts to \"earlier\" states - losing recent messages, pictures &c. It seems like the storage card (microSD inside the phone, inaccessible without voiding warranty) may have gotten loose. Some searching told me this seems to be a common problem with HTC Windows 7 phones. My phone is currently bricked with a \"STORAGE CARD NOT WORKING\" error message.I called HTC and they told me the phone\\'s warranty expired in November 2011, months before I purchased it and that I have no recourse except to send it in for out of warranty evaluation. Once they look at it, they will quote me a price, usually between $100-150, and if i decide against it, I will be charged $40 for my troubles.I feel silly having bought this phone despite numerous reviews that have cited this exact problem. Heed these warnings! This product come in perfect condition, with original charger and unlocked, I recomend100% I was a little disappointed at the beginning, thinking I was getting a 4S. But when I checked back on the item description, I realized that it was a 4 the whole time- I just didn\\'t read it well.Either way, I have enjoyed the 32gb of space, enabling me to put more music on my phone.I was able to unlock this phone easily with At&t. As a dual SIM Android Phone, its awesome, but once you load it up with Apps the 8Gb Memory disappears very quickly - even with the movement of most Apps to SD. Also Bluetooth fails me continually, but runs better if I keep over 1.5Gb of space in Storage. If you don\\'t use Bluetooth functionality (daily) its a brilliant phone. All this being said I may just have a defective phone. The Amazon supplier is great, quick delivery. This is an inexpensive, but truly excellent phone. I just returned from a trip to Costa Rica. The phone is small, light weight, worked instantly with the SIM I purchased at the airport. The sound quality is superior, I traveled all over the country. The ring was loud and even my husband who has poor hearing was able to use the phone and hear clearly. We called the USA and those calls came in loud and clear. The phone held phones numbers and was easy and user friendly. I was able to text, write notes, talk and it had other features. I highly recommend this purchase! This phone is everything i thought it would be nothing wrong with it all came on time and packaged perfectly.The only thing this phone is not supported by boost mobile,The phone company ive had for 2 years so i had to transfer to metro pcs so if you have boost think about it i transfered for just my first months bill no extra charges so yeah this phone is perfect Great handset for a very resonable cost. Great deal on the phone. Item came very well packed. The item meets its intended purpose. this phones radios don\\'t seem to work right! on auto gsm wcdma it\\'ll get stuck on edge... when it gets stuck it doesn\\'t go back to 3g or hspa without manually registering it on the t- mobile network! I even called T-Mobile and manually put in the apn settings and no dice! it lags a little bit on transitions too. just a little tho! aside form that it\\'s a pretty good phone! Extremely happy Even though it doesn\\'t look as elegant and rich as the HTC One, It is indeed more useful with the amazing features and the fast processor. It is very nice. Worth every Quarter of a penny!The motion features run smooth with a little bit of practice.HTC One vs S4The only thing which is highlighted in HTC One is the built quality and the camera.The S4 too has a nice camera but a poor built quality. It makes up because of a bunch of features Great phone evening was there. My husband loves those Excellent product!!! I had S4 and now s7, very satisfied again! Excellent. Product work well, as per specification except for a minor battery model difference. Apart from that the mobile works perfect. Excellent fast delivery. I love my new iPhone, I would recommend this to anyone looking to buy a smart phone. Such a great deal too. Thank you! I love it especially with dual sims so I can have to number. Instead of carrying 2 phone. I always have Samsung Galaxy with my daughter from 2,3,5, & 6 everything perfect! This is a simple phone that did exactly what I need it to....turn on and off allow me to make and receive calls while my phone was out of service. Because it is unlocked, i can also share it with family in the event they need a temporary solution to stay in touch! Appreciate having it! Description stated - \\'brand New in original retail box, Phone has Original plastic screen with all accessories have original packaging\\'. The phone I received was not in retail package. It was a generic htc package and the phone did not even have the plastic wrap. There was a sticker in the back of the phone. NB 08/13. Research on the internet comes up as New Breed Refurbished Phone inspected on 08/13. There is no warranty information nor user manual. I opted to buy this phone as the order was fulfilled by Amazon. The phone did not have any visible damage and so far in the past 4 days I did not have issues and the windows update went well. This is why I\\'m keeping this phone. There is always a disappointment when you receive the product not per the description. So buyers keep this in mind while ordering. You can easily find factory refurb models else where for around 175 or less Do not buy a Samsung galaxy grand prime because it I\\'s not what they say they are... it done not load or work like it I\\'s supposed to... very very unhappy with this phone. Bought for my daughter. Great value, in great condition. She loves it. General:Comes shipped for another language but that\\'s to be expected as the P705 was intended for the Chinese market, works 100% on T-Mobile so far - Look to your carrier\\'s website to see how to program your phone to connect to their data/MMS services, else it will not work, you must tell it where to connect - It is not a fault in the phone.Design:The phone is flat and square which is good because it slips in your pocket comfortably, the back isn\\'t as \\'grippy\\' as it seems it might be - A case or replacement back may solve this (I am used to the back of my Google Nexus 7 with it\\'s less-than-plastic backing).The buttons don\\'t sit out too far; just enough to identify and press when needed. The battery back is a little difficult to remove without a tool or fingernails as it does not slide off, rather than snapping on. This becomes a problem when needing to access the microSD slot which for some people may be often (Stock Android connects to your computer via MTP or Media Transfer Protocol which means it doesn\\'t allow the same ease of use as say a thumb drive and in the case of Windows 7 makes you confirm every file you copy over that it might not work on your device. There is also software you may download from LG for the device to transfer and backup data.)Specs, performance:The battery is as robust as to be expected, using apps, texting and such, I find I really only need to charge every other day, but this is no problem since I rarely find myself lost in the wilderness for a week.Actual battery life varies per user and the things running and connecting of course. A user smart with their battery would see days on standby, surprisingly as much as I personally turn on to mess around with the screen on, (Brightness at 28%, still very clear. The screen can get VERY bright.) the screen is the fourth on the list of things that pull power to my battery. The top items on my phone: Cell Standby, Android System, Phone Idle and finally the Screen. In the other devices I have used (Primarily tablets), the screen is usually the top pulling item, by grand leaps. This isn\\'t the case with the P705, the screen is rather easy on battery life.Power-wise, as noted, my other Android device is a Nexus 7 so I feel it\\'s apples and oranges, however the P705 holds its own against it, very few lags and no hang-ups, though I mind to restart my phone every couple days to clear out and let it start fresh. Installing Nova Launcher on as my default home, it performs with minimal lag, though I notice a slight stutter on screen transitions (Primarily the \"Swinging door\" transition.) The default launcher performed well, however, an LG customized ICS launcher. Nothing too spectacular, hence the upgrade to Nova Launcher. Runs most apps without issue, have not tested many games outside of Osmos, which proved to make the game stutter - It\\'s definitely not a gaming phone.Depending on your carrier, connection will always vary, however the P705 gets rather good connection that I have found so far, on average, I get better reception than I did with most of my previous phones. WiFi isn\\'t terrible, i don\\'t lose signal nor find that I get better performance than my Nexus, either.The speaker isn\\'t terribly loud but it would work well enough to carry out a speakerphone conversation as well as you won\\'t miss a call due to not hearing it. The battery was damaged... Had to buy a new one I\\'ve been on Android forever and this is my first iPhone... I love it! I was nervous to switch from my beloved Samsungs, but I don\\'t regret this at all. It took a day or two to get adjusted to navigating the phone, but that is to be expected. I still reach for my back button lol. I just wanted a phone that is reliable and doesn\\'t glitch out... and for some reason I wasn\\'t impressed by the edge screens on the new flagship Galaxy phones. I figured it would be a good time to buy an iPhone since the release of the iPhone 7 caused the price to drop on older models.With iOS 10 installed, I don\\'t feel like I\\'m wanting to instantly go back to my android. The display is beautiful even compared to the super amoled displays on other phones. They are both gorgeous in their own ways, and the 6+ is still very bright, colorful, and crisp. Everything is very fluid, beautiful to navigate, and the apps are so nice to look at! This phone just works. I\\'m impressed with the battery life as well and I hope this phone lasts for a while. THIS IS SCAM !I ordered an iPhone 6s 16GB \"New - Brand New ! Sealed!\" but i recieved an used phone which does not even work.It turned on just once, 3D touch wasn\\'t responding that well and Phone is completely dead now.I\\'m not even sure if this phone is apple\\'s real&original product.Amazon is refusing to replace an item and also problems about refund.I\\'m soo dissapointed. I was skeptical at first but went ahead and placed the order. iPhone came factory sealed and delivery was 2days as stated in the description. item as described. Pictures are very nice and sharp. The only problem with the rezound phone is that they normally are not very good for detecting the GPS signal. My previous phone has the same problem but my husband one has always been working well (he use different brand). I would still recommend this phone unless you use the GPS often. The weight and size of this phone are ideal in my opinion. It is also very very fast, water resistant, very good battery life, looks very good, unreal 4k video(tested and impressed... pausing the video looks like a photo even on a large monitor), has a clear sharp display, great audio and a fantastic (for a phone) camera. I loved my Sony ZL phone, got it wet so then went to the Z1 which is great but too big and heavy for me. This is the best phone out there for my needs right now and I believe this size of phone will make a huge comeback as it is truly ideal, great job Sony! (PS I am on T-Mobile and I don\\'t think I am getting LTE but still quite fast and battery drain is not an issue) It\\'s an ok phone fast service and quality product.Great stuff here you guys RoCK The has a short battery life. I am constantly recharging. The phone take too long to power up. I am strongly considering selling it and get another brand. I\\'m loving my new BlackBerry Leap! The touch screen is the best for productivity, the virtual keyboard is so quickly and the battery life is awesome. I purchased this phone a while back, my opinion on this phone is that it was not what I have asked for. When I ordered the cellphone it clearly stated that it was \"UNLOCKED\", when I turned on the phone, a Verizon screen came on, I saw it very strange that the screen came on with a Verizon sign on. As I put the SIM card in, it said it could not be read because it is not Verizon. At that very moment, I contact Amazon and I told them about the problem and said I should chose another phone than wait to exchange it for another. I really suggest people to read the reviews because don\\'t end up like how I ended up. All I needed was something to text and make phone calls on and to that end it does as expected. Voice dial works better than my last \"dumb\" phone. The physical keyboard is a big plus as I hate virtual keyboards with no \"feel\". Battery life is very good at about 4-5 days.Sorry, if you have to surf and e-mail, you\\'re really out of luck here.Does exactly what I needed and at a great price. My son loves this phone. He uses it for an MP3 player and its his own piece of heaven. Good deal Bought two of these one in November and the other in December. Both of them are acting up ie the screen freezes or blanks out periodically. The slot for the headphones is not working. Would not buy a BLU again. Going back to Samsung! Just as described. No scratches, works 100 %, new , perfect cellphone. Its missing a Sim card and I haven\\'t been able to find one anywhere for it. The product was not good, it always went off and the screen did hang most of the time. Even at the moment the screen is static for the last two weeks, I cannot call anyone or swipe to do anything with the phone. Well it would have been a 4 star, however, the microphone has quit working after 3 months of use (bought in May 15). pick up of sound is a shot in the dark, Did factory reset but this did not fix problem. I will be sending email to manufacture to get repair info. So the \"Hear me now\" does not apply anymore.AT7T LTE availability: Need to check your providers frequency for LTE, On my travels, This phone was not able to receive LTE in metro areas I visited. The reason for this it is lacking the 700MHZ LTE band in which there other product The Blue Studio mini 5.0 has.Battery life. I found the battery lasted reasonably well for the day when not on charge.. A suggestion, if you are at your desk, buy a USB cable or extension power cord to keep it charged. its perfect and excellente price, factory unlock and sealed condition! it is great and a good choice to every people Thank you for the wonderful phone. I was giving this phone as a gift and I really appreciate the great service Has some glitches, but works 80% great. The battery life is amazing. I get full 2 days. With a battery saver app, it goes for 3 days on a long weekend. It is sufficiently fast for me. exelente To bad it was Palm\\'s \"hail Mary\", and it didn\\'t go as well as they wanted it to. And now that Hewlett Packard has purchased Palm, and is all but ignoring this phone, it\\'s quickly degrading to the point where it will be nearly useless before it actually wears out. Sad ... like I say, this \"was\" the best phone ever.Addendum: HP has now disabled Google Maps on this phone, and re-routes any requests for map information to \"Bing\". This also disables dozens and dozens of other apps that depended on the Google Maps API. Hewlett Packard has gone beyond simply ignoring this phone, and is now actively disrupting it\\'s original functionality. There are class action law suits in the works, but nothing will ever come of them. HP has simply ruined the best phone ever. Still working and that is all that counts. :) No memory even after adding 32 GB to it still can\\'t download anything the charger that brings the phone comes with problems and not burden and also has problems microphone output, not recommended because pay for something new and seems used The phone is pretty, but lots of time the other person cannot hear me, sometimes it rings and sometimes it don\"t. It has a problem with charging I have brought to different charger and they still don\"t connect tight. I called my sprint services and ask is there a problem with the sprint system and they said no. EXELENT The phone seemed great. the problem was, my chip would not fit because it was an att phone, and I have T-mobile, and, I didn;t see a choice on amazon, where I could tell them I need a Tmobile phone. I ordered the phone, it said it would work with my company(some gp something), but, it didnt say, yes, it will work with your t-mobile account. Never said exactly, that it would. I\\'m sure the phone was great. I love Samsung. I\\'m scared to re-order, because, I tried specifically to say a t- mobile phone, but, I felt like the descriptions did not assure me it would work with my chip. So. I gave up... I love it ! very gd stay away with this product, after plug in my t-mobile sim card, it cannot recognize any internet connect at all, even 2G,3G... no internet connection, definitely this is a buggy one, and I have to pay for the international return shipping fee, seller is not responsible for this, u take risk by your own I ordered the Silver iPhone 6s 64 GB from FGS Trading. The phone came in good time. It was indeed internationally unlocked and worked in Jamaica. The phone is beautiful and works great! Would definitely recommend!!! excellent muy bueno I like the phone so far. Screen is a little touchy at times. I like the free clear protector that came with it,but I am ordering a new type of case that may help with that when it is in my pocket.otherwise it works fine. It was great Great Excellet! We signed up with Consumer Cellular and received a simple Motorola phone, which we got good signal reception. No dropped calls, no problems. We wanted to cancel our wired phone and dial-up internet connection, so we purchased the Samsung Galaxy S Duos s7562 to use as a phone and an internet hotspot for our computers. The Duos was not receiving any signal and it wasn\\'t until I worked with Consumer Cellular tech support, that I discovered it was not really misconfigured or broken. By climbing to the roof on a nearby building, I was able to connect and place a telephone call. It reminds me of the \"Green Acres\" telephone situation, which was mounted on a phone pole, due to the lack of wire, at the time of installation. Other than that, the device looked neat and might be fine for someone who lives and works in a strong signal area. This may or may not reflect on the results you get with your own Samsung Galaxy phone. I\\'ve been using his phone for over a month now and I absolutely love it. Yes, the display is small but it\\'s super colorful. The Google Play Store, lets you download plenty of apps that are compatible with this device.However it is a 4G phone, and my SIM is capable of LTE meaning I am not used to the slowness of the data. If you\\'re connected to Wifi there shouldn\\'t be a problem, and if you\\'re used to 4G data then then you should be okay.It has a 2 mega pixel main camera and a VGA front camera, and if you came here for a good camera... Well probably not the best place to look. The main camera typically gets the job done however.With 4GB of internal memory, adding an SD card is a good idea especially if you love music and lots of apps. I haven\\'t used very much of the data so I don\\'t have many complaints.The charger is mini USB but the metal part of the charger that connects to the phone is a tad longer than your average USB so don\\'t break it or lose it.Overall it\\'s a very good media player and I don\\'t regret purchasing it. I hope this review helps! good seller and god product very serius Have issues with calls dropping and screen freezing along with staying in 4g lite. I have my Samsung note for work so I know that it is available. It destroyed my 64gig sd card where I had my pictures and music saved. I bought 2 of these phones with the assumption that I would have lollipop by now. By the time that happens it will probably more version after marshmallow. Called customer service and the are clueless on if/when it will upgrade. Come to think of it my sd card bit craps that next day(something to ponder). Though the phone barely has any scratches or mishandling marks, the iPhone I received has a bad case of ghost tapping. Minus this annoying factor, the iPhone runs smoothly and the battery last as long as any other iPhone. The battery is horrible! Hardly holds an hour charge. The camera kicks rocks. Blurry photos. Other than that I have no problems with it. Except there is no swype. Oh, and the internet is slowww...WiFi connection is good though. And I do love the neon pink color..But the battery kills the deal. Returning it..Well, back to Samsung I go. I hate paying for their high a__ phones :( Very happy with my IPhone. I bought this phone the first day it came out, because I really wanted to have a big screen and my lg g5 only have a 5.3 screen, I am currently using it with cricket wireless and I get signal almost everywhere.pros:-screen alone is 5 stars, is amazing, good quality, good brightness even outside, great whites, love the edgeless design, I\\'m glad sony still uses lcd panels because amoled screens are prone to burn in.-phone is fast, I haven\\'t experience any slowness or lag, everything opens really fast.-speaker sound is really nice and loud another 5 stars for it.-battery life is the same or better than my lg g5, so I cant really complain here.-call quality is good, signal is good as wellcons:-only 16gb of internal memory, this is my main concern this phone deserves a least 32gb of internal memory, I downloaded a couple games and I only have 1 gb left. unfortunately you cant install apps directly to sd card. You can move some apps to sd card only if the developer allowed it, so some apps wont let you move them to the sd card. so this is a big downside.-hard to find quality cases and screen protectors-miss tap to wake a lot, I think this is one of the reasons I miss my lg g5-miss fast charging, this is the other reason I miss my lg g5 lol.anyways this is a great phone I have no regrets on buying this phone even though I paid full price for it, the only reason I\\'m not giving it 5 stars is because this phone deserved more internal storage and a bigger battery.UPDATE 1:after a flawless one week use, this last week the phone started experiencing problems. for some reason as others have said before, the cell radio turn off on their own for no apparent reason. I noticed this only happened when enabling LTE mode on crickets (ATT\\'s network) so unless Sony fixes this before my return period, ill keep it otherwise i will return phone. otherwise this is a fantastic device.UPDATE 2:SONY issued an update which fixed the lte dropping issue, now this phone is perfect I got this watch on Amazon about 3 or four months ago be Aust I thought it was simpler to the Apple Watch... BUT BOY WAS I WRONG!!!!!, Instead save your almost $30 and buy the MTK2502C it\\'s a fake version of the Apple Watch, it\\'s water proof, Has a heart rate sensor and looks exactly the same as the Apple Watch and its only $74 my lock button dont work but other then that its a very good phone Very good phone for the price. .I will be buying another Very nice and good cell for unlocked. Seller is awesome and would do business again. Phone performs great even with its mid to low end specs. The screen is great. Sharp and bright with nice viewing angles. The only thing that might bother some people is the UI isn\\'t the smoothest. It is still very livable without skipping many frames. It doesn\\'t bother me at all. Overall, awesome phone for the price. Worked right away with my t- mobile sim card. I bought this for father who lives overseas. He loves it. Even at this age, he can use the product without any problem. The product is very excellent Love this phone. My son in law recommended it, I am so glad he did. it works Well I loved the phone while it was working... I bought in the US and brought home (Brazil). I could use for 30 days, and now the phone is locked in the NOKIA Screen and wont work!! I am a bit terrified cause Brazilian Nokia Support may not help me to solve this problem or charge me like the price of a new one!! (REALLY hope I am wrong and they will help us customres) :( I hope I can post what will happen cause I am contacting the support now.I also sent an email to Amazon hoping they can help me out or also will try with Nokia in the US....I will rate 1 star for this case but usually for all Nokia celphones I use 5 stars!! Hope I can change to 5 in a bit! :)Lets see :( The only reason I gave it 2 stars was because it was in good physical condition. The phone would not activate or even recognize a AT&T signal. Not unlocked and not useful. Sent back and gave up after reading endless other negative reviews. These used phone peddlers are definitely the bad apples in Amazons barrel. thanks Good. Very good :) goood Was not the color it looked like The phone was junk. Whenever I put the sim card in, and then the battery on top, it would slightly move the sim card and not have it register. It took five or six times to get the cover on where the sim card wouldn\\'t slide in the spot. I wasn\\'t sure at first if it was due to the phone or the card, but I do now believe it was the phone. Besides that, the charger didn\\'t charge. I had it plugged in for over 10 hours and it didn\\'t charge at all.It was too close to the start of my international trip to return and get another one. I wish I would have bought a better phone - that extra money would have saved me some headaches of not having one when I arrived overseas.Would not recommend this to anyone. As expected I gave it one star because the LG G3 is a very good phone, however the one I received WAS FACTORY LOCKED :( using the unlock access code (For LG G3 (D855), enter 2945#*855#) I got to the manufacture lock screen where I was greeted with \"This phone is permanently locked and can not be unlocked\" DISMISS. Amazon is handling the return and refund beautifully and I will be ordering a new phone thru my service provider. Great I must say there customers service is very good and they are doing everything possible to resolve my problem. So as a result i will recommend everyone to shop with Wireovia We got an iPhone 4S and are very happy with the product. It came in an unopened package as advertised. We took it to Verizon and had no trouble getting our number transferred to it. Would definitely buy from these guys again. placed in the description that are new, and come with many stripes and details. DealFisher seller I guess I would not break any news by saying that Samsung does a great hardware. The phone is great to hold, looks nice, works fast and smooth. Still, comparing it to my Nexus 5, I like bare Android more than Samsung\\'s wrapper.This phone was purchased for my wife, who made a transition from iphone to Android, and it\\'s quite good as such:it\\'s elegant, right size (not the huge screen of other current phones), fast. The battery life is ok, but I would easily trade 0.5mm more width for bigger battery. Excellent Excellent! This phone was reported stolen and is on the at&t blacklist and is blocked from network use. It doesn\\'t work even for at&t like it said it would. I talked to an at&t personnel and she looked up the phone and it was reported stolen. After having the phone for 1 month it quit working. not sure if this is a real samsung or a clone, but this phone is a piece of crap! Don\\'t want to go through the trouble of returning it but I should. The signal is always in and out, and none of my Bluetooth devices are able to connect to this model. This isn\\'t my first BLU phone but ALL I can really say is I for sure got what I paid for this time around! I\\'m not big on phones or tech and I still wouldn\\'t recommend this phone to anyone. I bought this phone for my wife as a birthday present this year. I would give it a five star but its lack of handling apps gives it a 4. Battery dies fast when you use apps on it. She has it running with Net10 service and it works great! She loves it and overall its a great buy! Bought this phone for my 12 year old son. Was not sure it was going to do the trick, but it has :) Very happy with our purchase. My Nexus 5X got boot failure problem after a half year passed, and I found the repair service horrible.It took almost a month to get Nexus 5X back, and it didn\\'t mean it was repaired. After the 1st \"repair\", Boot failure problem was fixed but the speaker was completely broken. After the 2nd \"repair\", It came back without sim tray.If you really want to buy Nexus 5X and don\\'t want to spend almost 2 months without your phone, I recommend you to buy it with Nexus Protect option from Google Store, which would provide immediate replacement. Nice phone Overall: After a bit over a month of usage, I\\'d call it OK.PROs: It works. It has a camera and video player.CONs: The video player is not what I expected. Key pad is small. The view on the tiny screen is so-so.Okay, I admit, I haven\\'t used the phone a lot yet or gotten greatly familiar with it. I was looking for a phone that I could use in the U.S. and abroad, where I am living and working now, and I was looking for one I could use to record video/audio without having to lug around another device. (Is there a device out there for under $300, let\\'s say, that has an unlocked quad-band phone--not one that comes with the purchase of two-year cell phone plan, a PDA, and a decent video camera all in one?)Video record--20 secs at a time:The big disappointment was the video record. I was looking forward to having it available when I\\'m out and about and want to record something unexpected happening, which is fairly often in Nairobi. It records for only 20 seconds at a time. One time it didn\\'t even capture the audio. And, when I converted the videos to my computer, they were the inky dinkiest little things I ever imagined. I can only pray that the audio will at least record--there are times when all I really want is to record some sound...Russian:The phone, books, and keypad came in Russian. Now, of all the languages they could have chosen, Russian was a good one for me, since I have a Masters in it. I can see how that might be a bit tough though for someone who doesn\\'t know a language. Maybe they should provide some quickee instructions with the phone on switching the phone to English. Just a thought... The keypad in Russian is a little annoying. Maybe someday I\\'ll be so familiar with the keypad that I don\\'t need to look, but, alas, I have just gotten into txting the last couple years living in Kenya, where it\\'s really cheap. So, some of the Russian letters that look like English letters throw me off at times.Keypad:I am coming from a simple Nokia phone whose keypad was very nice for my fingers. I do not have big fingers, but the KRZR keypad is too small and hard to use for my taste.MP3 Player:Plays quite well...nice...I like it. I will look forward to using that in my car in Kenya...much easier than dealing with CDs (even if I had a CD player in the car). Not sure how that will suck the battery power--will have to find out.MicroSD card--no more than 2GB:I did see this somewhere later, but, do realize the phone supports no more than a 2GB card. I got a 4GB--doesn\\'t work. The 2GB works great.I haven\\'t tried the phone yet in Nairobi, where I will be using it extensively. So, basically, the jury is still out... Just wanted to give you my initial thoughts. first phone did not work i called them and they were great they did every thing to make me happy and to fix the problem. I would have no problem ordering from them again in the future i was very happy with this company. Very good morning,Best Regards ..(Amazon order: 105-8269691-6280222)I communicate with you by this route in order to notify the following:The equipment purchase was removed from the offices of Liberty Venezuela the 10th of May this year, to be on the phone the same present fault with the button on and blocking it does not work, additionally constantly appears on the screen window \"phone options\" (shutdown, restart, airplane mode) does not allow me to manipulate the phone as this window is constatemente, if to turn off the phone is not possible since the button located on the upper right side not work.Much appreciate an answer to my problem in such a way to comply with the warranty.thankshappy dayNayibet Moreno It works great! I love it I like the phone, just wish there were more options for accessories Very happy with items. Received as advertised. extremely slow u can\\'t hold any data Great value for money. Plus it is stylish. The iPhone is great. Just like it appeared, that\\'s how I got it. It\\'s a great product. I would absolutely recommend this company to anybody. great shape very good value To me it is the best small affordable smart phone on the market. It suits my needs. I bought my first iPhone off of Amazon back in January and I still have it- NO problems with it- Good as brand new! I traded it out for my old phone on my Verizon plan way before my 2-year-upgrade was due (because really, who can wait that long?!). Worked like a charm. Highly recommend. Came fast and works really good Great phone... Arriving at time. One of the best phone in 2014 and still serve me good. Love everything about this phone except for no micro sd slot and limited internal memory (I got the 16GB model). I had purchased an iphone 4 which was advertised as a Verizon phone. It was an AT & T phone and i had to return it I wanted to like this phone but I don\\'t. I hate it. It did not even survive a year. The phone literally took a $@!& and died the next morning. I am assuming it\\'s the charging port because the battery did not spin when I attempted the \"spin test.\" I love it Great. I personally like the phone but wish I would of picked a different phone because it messes up a lot. It glitches to much and dies wayyy faster the nit should but overall its ok just ok I will be getting a new phone again soon but this will do. 3 stars Works great and I am plased Love this Phone!!! GOOD Product is excellent, very fast, only cons is indoor pics are not that clear I am very happy whith my new phone. Amazing, when I compare with my old one. Phone worked great! Nearly perfect condition! Very Satisfied It\\'s been 2 and a half hours two things stop working sleeping monitor and predometer on this watch really ????? I need my money back pliz Great phone. It is hard to use with one hand unless you have very large hands. But using this makes me use my ipad mini less. Everything met my expectations just wish a case was sent based on the purchase price however I\\'m loving my phone especially the security features I was not happy with the watch....I bought it has a gift and it has failed to work properly. Works like a charm. Love BLU products - well made without being a wallet breaker. I\\'m wondering if my phone is even new.... starting to regret buying this phone & I just received it today. I cant even silence the camera shutter sound... Love this phone. Happy with this phone Good works grate I was pleasingly surprise to find out this phone has the latest Androind OS.It was relatively cheap and dual sim card. Great Size. I appreciate how it fits in my pocket and purses. However, the battery does not stay charged all day.... Works perfect! funciono perfectamente...it worked perfectly Other users don\\'t like the operating system, it does not have millions of apps available like the iPhone or Android phones have, but there are still plenty of apps available and if you are willing to pay for the apps there are plenty. I even find the voice recognition for text messages and Bing searches understands my voice better than Siri does on the iPhone. The camera is what makes this phone worth the money, with so many different modes it is easy even for novice camera users.Only reason for 4 stars is that with the camera grip, there is basically no protective case available for the phone. You have to remove the camera grip for a protective case to fit. Ordered a used phone from them. It arrived in almost brand new condition with charger. There was no box or manual but it was really easy to figure out. The phone itself is not impressive but it\\'s very rugged and is a great replacement with a clean ESN. Would order from them again. Excellent quality, only real problem the gps signal is not very strong Excellent item ... Just need more RAM, for greater capacity and will THIS COMPANY IS SELLING DUPLICATE PRODUCTS UNDER WRONG BRAND NAMES. I HAVE PURCHASED A SAMSUNG GALAXY S DUOS, IT WASN\\'T WORKING, WHEN IT TOOK IT TO SAMSUNG AUTHZ DEALERSHIP FOR REPAIR, THE ADVISED ME THAT, IT\\'S A DUPLICATE PHONE. I HAVE ASKED TO THEM TO REFUND MY MONEY BUT THEY HAVE REFUSED. SOMEONE NEEDS TO TAKE ACTION OR FILE A SUITE AGAINST THEM... TEACH THEM A LESSON... I bought this phone and had it sent to a US address where my parents live and they shipped it over to Germany where it works flawlessly. Unfortunately the company refuses to send the phone to military PO addresses, even though they are US addresses, so I had to do ti this way. As a side note, that kind of baffles me because it\\'s an internationally unlocked phone. Anyway, it\\'s lightweight and (in my opinion) beautiful. The back is plain but I don\\'t mind because I bought it so I\\'d have a great phone, not necessarily an overly pretty phone, plus I always use a case. It works quickly and I haven\\'t had any software or app problems on the phone.My few small complaint are:1. The interface is not like your typical Android, but I got used to it quickly and I personally enjoy the uniqueness it offers. I haven\\'t tried to use widgets because I don\\'t care about them, but I doubt they\\'d work on here.2. There is no app tray, so all your apps are forced to display on the screens which I didn\\'t like at first, but also grew accustomed to.3. Lastly, I\\'m unable to delete the weather app/widget that comes on the phone (shown at top of screen in photo) and it never properly updates so I\\'ve learned to ignore it entirely.Recently I started having issues with the GPS constantly searching and it not working properly for navigation apps (but finding me perfectly fine and quickly for check-ins), but my husband\\'s Sony phone has been doing this too and they started roughly around the same time. This could be user error (LOL) or service provider error, so I\\'m not sure if it has anything to do with the phone. It worked fine initially.I\\'m excited to test out its dual SIM capability on a visit to the US this month! I bought two devices and one battery was missing. Both came preloaded with kind of custom light OS for setting up which I had to disable. The scroll button of one of them moved a little bit down after 1 month of use but still works. They are truly unlocked. I\\'m using them outside US. It is not worth 146 usd I paid each. Regards. The phone works perfect. My son loved it!!! the shipment is really fast and don\\'t have problem with activating it. Thank you!!! AWESOME!! The quality of the actual product was very nice and sturdy. The only problems I had with this product was that the Bluetooth kept disconnecting every few minutes. The step counter would reset every so often without me prompting it to. It is a nice phone for a low price The phone is in good condition. The only complaint I have is that the battery dies quickly, but that might just be an iphone thing. excellent phone had 2 weeks and in that time froze up always shut down and after 2 weeks completely froze up and is worthless ... absolute garbage waist of money Great phone! Pay for RM-1072 and recieve an RM-1073. I love this phone. You gotta like it before buying it in order to love it. Firsts days the battery died pretty quick but once you get used to get the most out of it it can hold the day with decent usage. Installed a 32 GB micro sim card and runs without problem. Once I got more used to it, I could surf the web faster and type all kind of messages even faster. The screen can be as bright as you want but for battery life is better to have it very dim. Signal and data transfer works fine, also the hot spot app is very easy to use and can be used while taking a call. Everything at the same time. Overall I\\'m satisfied with this phone.And for the last but not least this phone is on the list of Motorola to recieve ICS update this year. Looking forward for more functions, hopefully battery saving and new functions!. One of the best phones I have ever had Love the extra memory. Try as I might I can not fill up the 32GB of memory. its a verizon phone , with option to get it partially working with other company SIM.I always get verizon logo with message this is not a verizon SIM.I would\\'t call it unlocked. or put it under this category. Love my LG G3 D855 excellente So my daughter said she wanted a new phone with a physical keyboard because her phone was to sow at texting . I told her go find one you want and come back to me and I will see if its good. Sure enough she found the Nokia E-5 . She really wanted a fast texting phone fast , so I decided to buy her it . After I ordered she said she was a little iffy and I said we can cancel if we want , but she said it was okay . When the phone came she was still at school so I decided to play around with the phone to test it . It worked very well , fits right in the hand and very fast internet connection and texting . The color is also very nice , it\\'s obviously better than the picture leads you to believe . So my daughter came home , saw the phone , and all she did was use it the whole night . She often talks about how fast everything is and how efficient it is . This phone I definitely good and I recommend to people who like to text a lot.PROS: Fast texting, good internet speed, nice app storeCONS: Sometimes internet kicks you out, a little hard to find stuff like how to turn your phone on vibrate or silent (but nothing google can\\'t fix), a little confusing the way things are organized but you\\'ll get used to it , texting buttons may be a little smaller for people with big fingers. todo muy bien,perfecto ,era todo como lo esperaba muchas gracias,100% lo mejor ,DIOS le bendiga......excelente, excelente, agradecido y muy conforme con todo Nice phone... the best Product is excellent, very fast, only cons is indoor pics are not that clear Great price and it does everything I need it to do! phone was horible. buttons didnt work. and it could not be activated. had to return it. do not recommend buying This was quite a good deal and now I have Straight Talk for less than $45 a month. Great phone that helps me save money! Its different from the original one this one is thicker and less friendly to use. Got this cell phone around December, held up nice. The only criticism I have is that the camera really isn\\'t that great, otherwise.. it does what its supposed to. So far i have had no problems with the phone. It has great reception, i had three bars in the middle of some woods when my friends had none. there was one strange thing that happened and that was a message came up every time it restarted saying launcher3 had crashed but i experienced no issues from this warning. i eventually traced it down to the sd card being slightly off center. The purchase was successful, all very good, I received the product in good condition and functional, everything concrete fast and safely without any mishap. Thank you!! Very good love it!!! excellent product A very nice smartphone. Could not link to my current Verizon account, but it does work well with my Wi-Fi. Fast, and light weight. Phone is awesome. Looks great only small almost unnoticeable scratches by usb port. Very very fast phone. I couldn\\'t slow it down playing anything yet. Didn\\'t like the way it arrived. The phone was moving in the box because they put the phone box in an envelope with nothing else. Other then that I\\'m very satisfied. It works very well I like this cell-phone Excellent Takes hours to charge (3-5hours). Pretty basic phone. Not that great. This phone is really good. My wife loves it and with the ProjectFi integration its really great. Just got it.Switched from my Galaxy Note 2...it\\'s smaller but not that much so.The screen is High Definition but it\\'s a bit washed out.It charges very quickly but the battery life is not good.GPS starts up very quickly for Navigation unlock my GSII.The phone is beautiful...very distinct.I don\\'t like how you can see the gridlines of the touchscreen in certain lighting (can\\'t on my GSII).Speakerphone for phone calls is not that great; music sounds good but the volume isn\\'t that great.These are my first impressions. I\\'ll update later.***Updated***OK - Back to Amazon my Xperia Z went. KUDOS to Amazon for having such a wonderfully efficient return/refund process. I returned the phone Monday, it arrived at their Lexington, KY warehouse Tuesday and refund was back in my bank account Wednesday. Wow.The phone was well made, great materials. But the washed out screen, HORRIBLE battery life, and tinny sounding \\'speaker\\' made the phone just not worth it. Don\\'t tell me about \\'turn wifi off, turn GPS off, turn data off\\'..You may as well just TURN THE PHONE OFF. If you can\\'t use the features of the phone, what\\'s the point?The relief I felt when I switched back to my beautiful and capable Galaxy Note II was very surprising. I LOVE my Note II.For the record, I \\'abuse\\' the heck out of my Note II all day long and the battery lasts all day and night. I\\'m very upset! I did not get my otter box case, instead I got a iPhone 5 battery replacement with tool kit! I don\\'t even have a iPhone 5! I spend almost $30 on a case I did not get!!!!! The phone was received damaged by water, do not check the product before sending it? Love the phone. Better than my last blu Awesome case! My wife loved the colors. She said it has been the best case she has had so far. She has dropped her phone and it hasn\\'t been damaged. love it It\\'s a great little cell phone. My husband has macula degeneration and needed something with larger numbers. This phone serves his purpose. Also its easy to use with none of the smart phone things that only confuse older people. Would recommend it to anyone who doesn\\'t need to go through labyrinths of information to find what they want. Great little phone. We love it. Still using it I like the quality of the product and recommend it to my friends Excellent product.It is a must to have for travelers.Really easy to setup and use. No Wifi CallingOther than that looks good feels good wish it was more popular for more cases and more support from online forums. Working fine so far. I find that Nokia phones overall provide excellent features. This Lumia in particular is very easy to use, has a modern design and, the best, the price is very good. Phone is excellent. I made a great choice. It\\'s working great so far. Thanks also for the prompt shipping! Nice phone, working fine and the dual sim is a plus. Good price also for the specs on this phone. I love this phone Disappointed (hence the 4 stars) by the fact that a Euro plug was sent since I think that an adapter from Euro to US should have been included. With that said, the phone so far works well but I cannot say much more as I have not begun to use it extensively. I especially like the use of the pen to take notes, a feature that I look forward to using a lot. Incidentally this phone is the replacement for my old trusted Nokia E7 which I still use. Ordered for a friend and she said best gift received. Excelent product as always. The missing star is because when you fix the cover in the back the camera gets covered. VERY GOOD The product is very excellent Love it got it very fast shipping upgraded was a little slow it\\'s finally upgraded to new 6.01,osGOT IT to work with tradcfone very happy with my new phone excellent service no problemsam a satisfied customer I have poor experience with this phone because it won\\'t charge the battery. I have this same phone but the battery is bad and the pixels are not doing well. Have had it for years and really like this phone. The battery from the new phone charged well in the old phone and it worked in the new phone. But if it won\\'t charge in the new phone then there is something wrong with the Remanufactacturing process. i bought it and it was dead very dissapionting Phone is great works fine my only issue is my charger quit charging after two week. very good, Thanks Phone is great! It was a huge upgrade for me going from the Samsung Galaxy S5 to the S7 Edge. :) No problems as of yet, phone runs smooth and fast! I love the camera! The seller (Wireless Everything) was even kind enough to even include a US wall adapter along with the order. very good product This Nokia phone is an excellent basic cellphone.Stores contacts, big buttons for pressing numbers and uses the Symbian OS.Only problem I\\'ve had with this is the back cover. It is indeed, like other reviewers claim, difficult to open. It requires some force or some fingernails to pry off.You have to be careful not to pry it off the wrong direction incase the clips accidentally break the back cover off.The phone still works without the back cover. (i turned it on after I switched sims just to try it out.)Other than that, sound quality of the phone is good. People hear me clearly when i talk to them. It has good loudspeaker, volume can go really high.It\\'s small enough and has a solid feel to it. This is my first smart phone and although I was spoiled with my simple flip phone, I am learning to love the many features. I now take my phone everywhere. EXCELENT.... 04/05/2012 UPDATE: I want to do a quick comparison between the Nokia C6-00 and Android phones, specifically Samsung Nexus S by Google. I\\'ve been using the Google android phone for the past 11 months and it did EVERYTHING I needed it to do from paying for Starbucks coffee using a Starbucks app so I didn\\'t need to carry my Starbucks card around and accessing multiple MS Exchange accounts to the interface and OS being slick and nimble as well as Google directions/mapping/GPS; the MAJOR downside to smartphones such as Android and others is the fact that they are battery drainers because of the intense use of power for the OS and display especially. I could not last more than 6-8 hours on Android and this is with setting the Display to the lowest brightness at all times which is a pain when outdoors in bright sunlight. That was the ONLY issue with my Android. Anyway, it did everything I needed so I stuck with it. Until recently the sounds stopped working. So I sold it and now I am back with Nokia. The strength of Nokia is the battery lasts a good 14-15 hours on standby (not sure why this Amazon description states 16 days or so, no, 15 hours, so at the end of the day before going to bed, you need to charge it up again for the next day). I can only add ONE MS Exchange email account on Nokia and I also have Gmail installed. The OS is not as slick and fast as Android and there is a \"white screen\" lag, but you put up with it. The sounds, ringing, call quality and reliability of the Nokia as a PHONE first and foremost is second to none. The Android (Samsung) had low ringing volume even at maximum. Also Sprint service for the Android was weak in my area, so ATT under Nokia was better. The Nokia is a \"workhorse\" of a phone that is loud (volume, I like!) and does a barely ok job at being a \\'smart phone.\\' I will keep using it for now because of long battery life and I can switch out the SIM card to my flip phone using the same data plan for traveling using a small flip phone, esp. overseas like Europe (ATT only charges $10 month for unlimited data since it is not considered a smart phone versus minimum $30 for smart phone). Will I eventually switch to a smart phone when something I like comes out, YES, of course, the Android experience (except for battery life) did EVERYTHING I needed a smartphone to do (rich apps for banking, Starbucks, etc) and my LIFESTYLE. What will I look for in a smart phone next time? STRONG BATTERY LIFE (EASILY LASTING 15 HOURS ON STANDBY OR BASICALLY WHAT I CALL A \\'WHOLE DAY\\' BEFORE CHARGING AT NIGHT), LOUD RINGER AND VOLUME, 4G CAPABILITY, HANDLE MULTIPLE MS EXCHANGE EMAIL ACCOUNTS.06/20/2011 UPDATE: Bought this phone in September 2010. There is still a slight lag (in the form of a \"white screen\") in between applications but other than this and the slight heft (weight) to the phone, it is a good sized pull out keyboard phone. For a while the Ovi maps and Ovi store apps did not work, I finally figured out I needed to delete the old files from apps manager and redownload Ovi maps and Ovi store. The trick is it is a Catch 22, you cannot download Ovi maps with Ovi store (the PC sync did not work for me in the first place), and you cannot if Ovi store did not work, I finally went to the browser and searched download ovi store and did it that way and once I go Ovi store working, downloaded Ovi maps and then everything works now. The music was a trick, you need to sync to your PC and copy and paste to the C6 after created a \"Music\" folder, then in the C6 press music and then library and then \"Options\" and then refresh the list and then your copied and pasted music will show up, otherwise you will be figuring out why it does not show up after a while, you need to manually refresh the music library!I added somore more apps like a flashlight and games, etc. It is 100% working and a nice little phone. However, my main phone is a Samsung Nexus S 4G from Sprint because it is a PURE GOOGLE experience on android, it is faster and smoother, and because I rely on gmail and Google calendar and Google everything apps, it just works for me. This C6 is a travel phone for me, for example I also have a Motorola Ming A1200 flip phone I used in Europe and the C6 will also be a travel phone for me when I do not need to take my larger Nexus S 4G with me traveling. So the C6 is powered off, all set up, and stored away in my closet until my next travel trip (the last time I took it I went to Idaho and Oregon on business) because the battery life on the C6 lasts a whole day+, the flip phone Ming A1200 was even better, a few days battery. The Nexus S 4G I charge every night and can\\'t beat the apps and user experience on nexus S.Recommendation is 3 stars now from 2 stars. I would recommended it but would advise of the heft and the white screen. Everything works on it though, but with MS Exchange you can only add one email address so I have a MS Exchange address and a Gmail address, which is basically what I need for email.11/1/2010 UPDATE: HAD THIS PHONE FOR A FEW WEEKS NOW, THE \"WHITE SCREEN\" BETWEEN SWITCHING SCREENS, ETC IS GETTING ANNOYING NOW, FOR $300+ OR SO I PAID FOR THIS PHONE I EXPECT A FASTER PROCESSOR. I AM CHANGING MY STARS FROM 4 TO 2; I WOULD NOT BUY THIS IF I KNEW HOW ANNOYINGLY THIS WHITE SCREEN WOULD BE.I am reviewing Nokia C6 here first since I had time to play with it, I will review the N900 soon in a bit under the N900 product site on Amazon (I reviewed the N900 on 10/13/10 so look for it under my \"Kingmonkey\" ID). The C6 . . . I couldn\\'t decide between Nokia N900 and C6 (did not want new N8 coming out end of September 2010 since there was no physical keyboard), so I bought both N900 and C6. Phones do not come with a case to hold, which is a disappointment considering how much each phone costs. For some reason Nokia only sells OEM cases for these phones to the European market, if you go to Amazon UK site or Nokia EU site you will see cases made for N900 and C6, so I had to go to Amazon UK site to order an OEM case for N900; the C6 on Nokia EU site has some nice ones but could not find them on Amazon UK and on Nokia EU site I cannot order them online being from the USA as you need to go to a retail location in Europe. Anyway got some generic case (more like a pouch) for the C6 from Amazon UK.The C6 is a nice looking, stylish phone, good size phone, not too thick or long at all, it\\'s fairly small and fits in your shirt pocket if you are a guy. Made of quality materials and feels like a quality product from the weight of the phone and also when you slide the keyboard out, it is stiff and not moving about. The top row keyboard key is a little close to the top half of the phone so when you type your thumb hits the top and gets in the way; not a deal breaker for me as I just learn to adapt. Those with bigger hands (fingers) may find the keyboard a little cramped but I wanted a smaller smart phone compared to the other ones out there such as Samsung Galaxy or Motorola Droid, so it is expected to be smaller overall as that is part of the appeal. Physically that was the only issue, again, Nokia is stylish, smart looking, and as always, love their Nokia ringtone theme. One last thing on the physical side, being a middle of the road phone (between N8 and lower end Nokia phones) it doe snot have al of the bells and whistles hence the lower price. One feature I wish it had, like the more higher end N900, is a camera lens cover, the camera is just exposed to dust, etc; the C6 does come with a factory \"screen protector\" and since this is a new phone and you can\\'t buy a screen protector just yet I suggest leaving it on to protect the screen, since after I set up the C6, the screen protector is scratched from my use of the phone (normal use with fingers swiping back and forth, mind you, I take care of my nice things, gently putting it down, wrapping it in napkin until my pouch comes in the mail, wash my hands and dry them, no lotion, before I handled my phone), so even with all of this the screen still gets scratched slightly if you look at it at an angle. Anyway will need to buy a screen protector when they are available and hopefully the one that came with it will last.On the software side, the 2GB microsd chip only holds the California map and voice navigation (street names + male voice both for US as two separate files); that\\'s about 2GB total. If you want all of US and other countries, need to buy a 16GB microsd but even with this not sure if it can hold all the maps as you will need to delete some still as some maps are several gigs(I think 16GB additional gigs is the limit the C6 can handle for a microsd card). I don\\'t travel a lot outside of California so it does the job and don\\'t need to buy a bigger sized microsd card for now, I can wait until I need it and by then the microsd card price will go down.The other major issue is I use Google calendar, right now you can use MS exchange to set up google mail, calendar and contacts but it imports ALL of my gmail contacts into my C6 even though I don\\'t actively keep in touch with all of them, I suppose you can choose to update only calendar and gmail and skip the contacts, don\\'t remember if this is an option. The calendar also only updates my main Calendar so others I created, including Holidays calendars, bill due date calendars, etc do NOT get imported. This was a deal breaker for me so I deleted this newly created/added gmail account and all of the contacts and email and calendar got deleted, which is what I wanted and it went back to how it was, being empty. By the way when you import this way, any contacts or information you had in the calendar gets overridden with the new import, so my one contact I created with a photo and all got overridden with the import. I had to reenter it. Anyway my workaround is to use instead of MS Exchange option on Nokia to add Google accounts like gmail and calendar, etc, I used the \"Gmail\" option via the email icon to set up the email account and it works well. As for Google calendar, there is a Google Mobile site and one bookmark webpage you can set up is for Google Calendar, so for my Internet application I set my default homepage as the Google calendar address so when I want to look at ALL (holidays, bills, color coded too) of my Google calendars I just open up that bookmarked web page homepage and it is there updated in real time by Google. As for the Ovi calendar, don\\'t use it, maybe I\\'ll look at it just to see what day it is every sooften. So I get my Google calendar but via a webpage site, not the Ovi calendar because like I said the MS Exchange way to sync gmail mail and calendar and contacts only gives you the main calendar, no other calendars created as discussed above.I also downloaded OVI software to my PC and the linking between the C6 and Ovi software on my PC works well, this is how you sync the photos, maps, contacts, etc from your PC to the C6, also faster way to update your C6 with software updates since you download them from the PC first and then link your C6 to the PC via a USB cable and the data transfer is faster. Otherwise you would have to do it over airwaves on the C6, which is slower even using 3G but you can connect to wifi if available using the C6.I customized my desktop icons, which is pretty cool, I added a couple rows of frequent contacts, then 3rd row from top Gmail, then a couple row of shortcuts below such as web access, a bookmarked web page, calc, camera, last row has messaging icon, then I downloaded an app for messaging, including google talk, from the Ovi app store by searching for \"messaging\"--it\\'s called Nimbuzz and with this you choose your account type, Google talk, Yahoo messenger, whatever . . . at first I was lookign and looking for Google Talk app but it does not exist, you have to access Google talk through this 3rd party app Nimbuzz or something else equivalent (it was a free app) and it works perfectly fine. The C6 home screen icons,being Symbian software based, is a bit \"cartoonish\" when compared to more sophisticated phones like the N900 or Droid icons or Blackberry 9000 Bold, but it\\'s fine and the learning curve is not steep to learn to master the C6 menu and navigation as discussed above.Overall I am happy with the Nokia, good size, small bar type smart phone, good looking, quality materials. The C6 is Symbian based and my N900 is Maemo based so another reason I bought both to compare and see how I like them. C6 works with ATT 3G so since I have an existing ATT SIM card it works great, the N900 I signed up for a T-Mobile individual plan text+web+voice and the N900 3G only works with TMobile 3G, So I am set here; if I used the ATT SIM card the ATT 3G does not work with Nokia N900 and would have to settle for EDGE (non 3G). Email me at darian.chin at gmail dot com if you have questions. The headphone jack has started malfuctioning within 3 months of use. It was only 186 when I got it, phone came in a week. It works and looks great, come with a case too they are hard to find. OK Good phone. Very fast. Screen resolution is nice and clear BUT you can only install few apps from Google play store before it starts to give you out of space error. Installing a SD card won\\'t help as not every app can be installed on SD card. You can move few of the apps to SD card but partial files still remain on internal storage leaving you very less space for installing others. Manual sucks also. Most of the stuff you have to figure out by spending time searching online. Speaker is not loud enough. The camera of the phone is very good.OS is work fast.However, it is NOT support for LTE; it only has 4G Very reliable case. My wife loves it and is very durable. It\\'s a great phone, so much bigger and lighter than my girlfriend iphone 5. She\\'s jealous now and wants this phone too. There is no coment I get the Right order. It is perfect! need directions First let me say Amazon is Awesome!! I bought this phone from USA Wholesalers. But it was fulfilled by Amazon so I got it delivered to me in two days!! The color I got was white and I love it. I was kind of scared because there were so many good reviews on it. So, in the back of my mind I was like this all cant be real. But guys I did my research. I looked up reviews, watched youtube videos and all. After about a week of research I went ahead and bought this phone. I am sooooo happy I did. I took out my SIM card from my At&t \"unsmartphone\" and popped it into the STAR in about a minute it saw that it was an At&t SIM and BOOM!! Everything was working!!! And I mean everything So now I have a \"Note\"(guys it look just like it and that\\'s what EVERYONE thinks it is) Smartphone. All prepaid for 50.00 a month(plus tax depending on where u live). And everyone else I know who wasn\\'t as smart as all of us(that is if you buy the phone) is paying 100.00 or more for a Smartphone plan. And under contract, worrying about going over minutes, texts, and data. I don\\'t have to worry about any of that, pay way less than them, AND my phone is the COOLEST ever!!! Lol. Just a little of what it does:In minutes I downloaded Skype, Facebook, Mp3 music downloaded, about 10 songs. ALL OF IT WORKS!When my teenage niece and nephew saw my phone (15 & 16, u know teenagers know about phones) they thought it was a \"Note\" and loved the screen and size. While I was visiting they had my phone the entire time. Taking pictures with the front and back camera. Downloading cool games for me, like fruit ninja(love that Geico commercial..lol) and temple run,etc. They didn\\'t want me to go Bc they loved my phone..lol(and they both have Driod phone by Verizon).The only small \"con\" I can say right now is the battery doesn\\'t last as long as a non smartphone. But it does last pretty good taking in consideration I\\'ve been playing with it all day on and off.Listening to music, downloading songs, on facebook, texting, making calls,etc. After all that its just a little below half full. I started using it this morning full force so its been about 10hours. So u can be the judge on that. Its pretty cool with me. I\\'m going to go buy a car charger so when I use turn-by-turn navigation, I won\\'t have to worry about my battery dying. And it comes with two batteries anyway. So I am good!! So good luck guys I hope my review helps you in your journey for an Awesome phone!! Do your research, don\\'t rush if you\\'re not sure. But if you\\'re like me after you\\'re research you will be back, and buy this phone!! I don\\'t think you will regret it. I know I am loving it right now!! It\\'s a very good choice!!! Happy Hunting!!! touch screen died after only 5 months of use Excellent phone! Maybe I got a defective one, but I just returned this phone because no one could ever understand me when I talked on it. Other people sounded very clear, but when I talked, they said it sounded like a foreign language no matter how I held the phone and even after troubleshooting. I will give them one more chance since this doesn\\'t seem to be a common problem. Nice to make a purchase from a company who supports our servicemen! The product was easy to fit iPhone in. The case seems to fit phone perfectly! So far, it appears to be living up to all that was promise since purchased about 2 months ago. At the same time as protecting my phone, it also is honoring our servicemen! had this phone for a few months and at first it was okay. After a while it started getting slower and slower even when I didn\\'t have many apps installed. The apps also kept force closing themselves especially Facebook all the time! however, the camera was great, but I don\\'t think I would recommend this phone. Disappointed! No instructions.... Purchased it as a present for a teenager, who is very \"tech\" smart and they weren\\'t sure what to do because there wasn\\'t a brand on it to be able to go to a web sight to research. :-( This is an excellent phone. Very easy to use. Good size screen for texting & calling. Just one issue so far as a phone call is terminated. The \\'end call\\' icon moves up the screen too rapidly & the user must scroll down again to find it. I have to check to see if it is a setting issue. Would recommend this phone. The Pastor will be happy from the gift that we got him! Blessings to your company! Thanks You very much!Regards,Emi Aguila I purchased this phone and it has not failed me since. I absolutely love it a way better upgrade than my previous phone! I give it a five star because its a great phone for such a cheap price. Its has excellent cameras and battery life is very good . I have been using it for almost 2 months now and no problems so far. Love it Similar to Xperia Z but I think it is better, but it has good screen Gorilla Glass protection and scratch very easily. Excellent camera especially in low light The Samsung J7 is just what I had hoped for. I was looking for a phone with a good camera and sufficient storage. I have downloaded several apps and still have plenty of room for more. So far I am very happy with this phone. It works good for the price you pay. great phone great price! We use HTC phones and this is a gift for someone overseas. The price was excellent and the phone arrived in time and in superb condition. I would strongly recommend the seller and would gladly buy from them again. Yes, this is what I say about every seller whom I\\'ve bought from through Amazon - I\\'ve never had bad service, ever. LOVE this phone! Positive:- Good condition, no scratches! Is like a new in outside.- No software and speed problems, like a new too.- Working great on Brazilian network, I believe is really worldwide.Negative:- The battery is not 100%, I believe that battery is long 20-30% less than original.Neutral:- Don\\'t came with the earphone and the original box, but is fine to a refurbished one. I bought this phone for my Mum. I like it \\'cos its no frills and I expect it will serve her well with basic stuff like make and receive calls. Way better than I expected. Will be doing more business with LeTV. Wasnt as described they didnt send any charger and it had a cracked case. Good cell Bought this in December it now will not charge so had to buy another one. this is pretty neat but I have an iPhone and the capability is very minimal. Only hooks up as a speaker phone or to control music. At the end of the day it\\'s a very cheap good looking watch, intelligent or not. It\\'s comfortable and the band does seem to be a great quality. The phone is good and meets my basic needs. However, the scroll down manual is unclear in many areas. Sending and receiving text messages are unclear. Have called others who have similar phones for guidance. Broken within a week of minimal use. Constantly dropped signal. The screen is horrible.Returned. (thank you Amazon) Christopher So far so good. Wish I could update the OS to the latest android OS (lollipop). Other than that, OK. Less than 2 months and the phone wont charge. It is useless without charging. Wish I could give it a negative star rating. Love my phone, the only thing battery don\\'t last as long as I thought, I have to full charge it 2xs a day (I think it depends on the use during the day) and other thing to mention screen protectors don\\'t work well on edge they come out quickly when you put the cover. But besides that its a great phone, I compare it to a IPhone 6 and this phone haves more features then an IPhone 6 camera is way better both video and pictures. Works good on our lan and vr box. Very happy with the phone. The manual is poorly written. I have had to ask someone to teach me how to use it. It\\'s very nice, is good, but did not come unlocked or with other language options, only English, Mandarin and German. The camera is great. It\\'s a bit expensive, is light. This phone cannot be activated because it was not properly cleared before it was sold to me. it arrived on time and i love it maravilloso i was working for few das then i couldn gothru so is no working no more I purchased this phone 8 months ago. I was really excited about receiving a mid-level Android phone for so cheap. I used the phone with the stock operating system for 4 months. I hated the phone in the that duration of time. Despite the good hardware, the phone was sluggish and froze on me constantly. I felt like I had a legacy android phone. When you have to reboot your phone 4 times a day to keep it running, you know something is wrong. Then came the revelation: I wiped the phone of its OS/Rom and installed a custom ROM/OS. I put CM9/Android 4.0 on the phone. Guess what? Everything runs phenomenal! My wife has a Samsung Galaxy S2 and my phone now runs immensely faster than hers. I never experience lag or freezes, the GPS works flawless and fast. Honestly, I switch between 10 different apps in a matter of minutes and the phone never slows down. It runs extremely fast! I love it so much and it has now become my favorite phone. I\\'m glad I managed to save and salvage it because now it has become the gem I truly wanted. I returned. Product was exactly as described This phones battery drains fast no matter how u adjust the screen resolution. The phone gets hot and call quality very poor. Would not buy this phone again. I would rate this at about a 10 on a scale of 10. It took me a few days before I figured out that the CLR button is the back button for the menu system. Knowing that really helps alot. The menus are well layed out and the options very clear. The buttons on the phone seem big enough and are easy to press. The phone seems solid, but light. Overall construction seems sturdy. The LCD screens are very clear. I LOVE THIS PHONE I got a refurbished when i got it looks like a new oneGot it on time Thank you Thank you Such a great phone. Got it six months after it came out in 2012 and just upgraded to another phone a few days ago (2016). Very solid, and sturdy. I had it in a rubber case that I bought at the 99 cent store and dropped it many times but the screen never cracked. And the home button, power, volume, and vibration switch still work. Got lucky I suppose. New updates have made it slow though. I changed the battery myself twice since 2012 and it worked pretty well, lasted me all day sometimes but I only texted and used instagram/facebook/web, I didn\\'t game. Since then I bought three of the same for my family as well. People made fun of me for having such an old, small screen, fat, phone compared to their iPhone 6s, etc. but it still works just fine. I\\'ll miss you my sweet, fat, slow prince. BlackBerry Curve 3G 9330 Phone, Gray (Verizon Wireless)Adquiri 2 telefono de estos y ha sido imposible usarlos en Venezuela, por favor que posibilidad hay de cambiarlos, lo acabo de recibir el dia 26 de noviembre de 2011. indicar direccion donde puedo devolverlos y a nombre de quien por favor Phone looks new. The price was great and I would definitely buy from JemJem again This is an amazing phone! I purchased this to replace my Blackberry 9700 because it was starting to act crazy. It got to the point where the phone would freeze when a call came through only to unfreeze when the caller hung up. Finally fed up I chose to get this device. Originally I was not interested in this phone because I was still scarred from the G1 experience and wanted nothing more to do with Android. After my friends found out I was intensely looking into the HTC HD7 they worked diligently to change my mind and steer me back to Android. This smartphone does everything and more. I will be as detailed as possible about this device.PackagingWhen I received the package I found that it was very well put together. The box, of course, was open because the dealer needed to remove the sim card and to unlock the phone. Otherwise the phone was pristine and looked like I had ordered it from Tmobile. The items that were included was the phone, travel charger extender, data wire, battery, 16 GB micro sd card, Samsung premium in-ear earphones, and the manuals. One thing I did not like about the charger was that there is not a wire attached to the travel portion so you have to always use the data cable to charge the phone. This looks like it\\'s the norm for this line of phones, so no quality loss on behalf of the dealer, just simply Samsung\\'s poor designing. The back of the phone is a little flimsier than I would like, but that\\'s all opinion. The weight of the phone is not heavy at all but is so sturdy that one would think that a metal back would make it a little classier. I have the Samsung Behold as well, much cheaper than this phone, and it has a really nice metal-like back on it. Overall, however, the packaging was very professional.ScreenThe screen on the phone is a four inch super amoled screen. The colors are very vibrant and crisp with no visible pixelation.NetworkI have Tmobile unlimited prepaid service, which is $70 a month. I had absolutely no issues in getting service started. I live in an area where my blackberry constantly stayed between edge and 3G, never fully 3G service so I had no high hopes for this device. However, I was pleasantly surprised when I installed my sim that the indicator was telling me that I was on the 4G network. I have been on this network all day and it has not dropped bars and has remained a steady 4G so I am thrilled about that. The HSPA+ service definitely works and the connections are extremely fast. No issues in that department.Email SetupI had a little difficulty setting up my email addresses on the phone. I tried fruitlessly when I first turned the phone on to activate my yahoo accounts and the server kept stating that it was not available and could not process my request. I gave up for a few hours and tried again and it did connect. If email is important to you, it may be a slight headache to activate but will run smoothly when it\\'s actually configured. I found that I needed to set up a gmail account in order to use the Marketplace. While it is not necessary to have a gmail account to access the OS upon first turning the phone on (like the G1), you should take into account that to use this feature you will have to create an account. I still have not synced my student email to the phone because it\\'s asking for features I do not have (domain). In comparison the Blackberry 9700 allowed me to sync my school account with no issues and never asked for a domain. I just input the email address and password and off I went. This is a slight annoyance but not the end of the world.MessagingMessaging is pretty standard here. The setup and the color scheme makes it enticing to look at and operates beautifully. There are two keyboards on the phone: Swype and Samsung. I am not much on swyping because I kept making mistakes and that is slightly agitating. I changed the keyboard to Samsung standard and my headache of texting went away!Call LevelI found that there were no issues on the calls that I placed. I heard no static, the calls didn\\'t drop and that\\'s all one could ask for. This phone does support WiFi calls. I made a few calls on WiFi and also found no issues in the quality.BluetoothIt took me less than a minute to sync my Bluetooth with this phone. The phone found the device in about five seconds, found the password OTA and entered it for me and then connected. I was shocked at how fast and effortless it was.BrowserThe internet browser is really decent. I was able to go to every site that I attempted with no issues. This phone has adobe flash embedded in the browser so therefore you are able to view video\\'s within various websites without the video\\'s being attached to YouTube which is really nice.Battery LifeThe battery life on this phone is excellent, as far as I can tell. I charged the phone completely when I received it without turning it on to ensure that I did not destroy my battery power before I even got started. I don\\'t know if that\\'s a myth, but I charged first just in case it wasn\\'t.Overall this is a nice device and definitely worth the amount of money it\\'s listed for. I have been looking at and reviewing the specs for weeks now and I am glad that I made this choice. I would recommend this to anyone on the Tmobile network but I cannot definitively say that this works on other GSM carriers because I was not able to test other carriers. Minus the battery charger, the back cover, and email issues I give this device a 4.5/5.0!**Edit June 27, 2011**This phone has a really nice, crisp, vibrant display but one problem I have found is when sitting outside in the sunlight you almost cannot see what\\'s on the screen. For this inconvenience I am dropping this review down to a 4.0. What is the point of having a mobile device if you cannot see the screen outside which is the primary purpose of a portable phone?Another issue I have stumbled on is that the ringtone does not always ring. There are times when I have notifications when I turn the screen on but I did not hear the tone go off. For this to be fixed you have to turn the phone off and back on. I don\\'t know if that was just my device but that has annoyed me a little. The ringtones are also a little lower than I would like.I have been enjoying this device, but there are some issues one cannot overlook just because I like the phone. I still recommend it however if these issues are enough to agitate you then I would find something else.**Edit June 29, 2011**I never reviewed the video and music player because I had not tried them at the time of the original review. I typically don\\'t use my phone other than for what it\\'s intended for because I have a Zune HD which is music and video ad I like to keep media seperate from my phone because of the battery power usage however I wanted to see what else this phone could do. I have .avi movies on my computer so I decided to sync some to the phone to see what the quality really looked like. I was blown away at how crisp the screen was! When listening to the movies through earphones you have the ability to listen in 5.1 surround sound and it sounds like you are in the movie theater. I really enjoyed this feature. The mp3 player was delightful as well. I listened to an entire 12 song album and viewed a 1 hour 50 minute movie on this phone without being plugged to the charger and my battery never dropped power bars. I am thrilled with the battery life in this respect and that the media on the phone does not drain it. Very nice experience!**Edit July 5, 2011**I took a mini trip for the 4th of July to an area in my state that normally has decent coverage on T-Mobile\\'s network. I ran into a lot of problems with this phone when I got into this area because the phone is provisioned for HSPA+ and this area is Edge/3G, more Edge than 3G. When I tried to use my phone I continuously got dropped calls or my calls would not complete and I am not going to get started on the net service out there. Because of the phone constantly looking for a 4G connection it sucked my battery down rather quickly and my phone just wasn\\'t working. I am glad that this was just a getaway and not where I live, however, it is imperative that if you are considering this phone that you go to [...]and check the coverage very carefully because if you are not in a 4G area there is a great chance that you will assume that the phone bites when in actuality it\\'s the coverage, not the phone. I am not too sure about the AT&T customers and how they may fare with this issue because I do not have an AT&T sim, but I would send my advice their way also. Check the coverage at AT&T if you have that service because your sim will be hitting their cell sites.**Edit July 9, 2011** Wireless TetheringI know this is a lot of updates, but I am still finding new options on this phone. So, I was in the Android Marketplace wanting to find a tethering service for this phone because my Blackberry 9700 had a tethering service named Tether and it was great and useful while I was at work. I found the same app in the marketplace and attempted to download it. Much to my annoyance and dismay it was not easy to set up. I had to download something called Samsung New PC Suite which allowed you to install the device on the computer and sync music and video\\'s to the phone. While playing around with my settings I found that I was able to plug my phone into the computer with the PC Suite, activate tethering on the phone, and connect to the internet! I was not on my wifi at the time and I was confused because my pages were still loading on my computer. I did not have to download any 3rd party tethering program (and pay for it) because this phone has a built in tethering program and no, I did not have to pay extra for that feature on the phone. Here are the steps to activating the wireless feature:1. Download Samsung New PC Suite (preferrably an updated version) and install the program.2. Plug the phone into the computer and wait for the drivers to install, in which case you should receive the popup in the bottom right tray that says that everything installed and you should be able to use the phone.3. On your phone, hit the backspace key if you have a screen giving you three options which are for the Kies Firmware Update, Mass Storage, etc. After you hit the backspace key you should be back to the main screen on your phone.4. Hit \"Applications\" and scroll over to \"Settings\". Click on \"Settings\".5. Tap \"Wireless and Network\", then tap \"Tethering\".6. You should have a \"USB tethering\" option. Tap this option so that a checkmark is in the box. In your task bar at the top of the phone, you should see tethering enabled. You can hit the house to go back to the main screen on the phone.7. If your computer is Windows 7 and configured like mines you should see a little mini computer in the task bar next to the time. This will tell you that the connection is active. If it has a yellow bar next to it give it a few moments to connect to the internet. At this point you can surf the web! No extra money to put out, no gimmick, just internet.I am super glad that I was able to figure this out because I downloaded a trial and did not pay for the app but once I figured out how to get the app installed on the computer I was going to pay for the full app which was, like, $32 dollars. That\\'s a lot to pay for a feature you already have for free, in my opinion. If you run into any issues trying to install this then there are support forums that will walk you through the issues. I cannot say that this is the same process on Vista or before because all of my pc\\'s have been updated to 7. As far as AT&T I cannot say if they allow this connection because I also have no AT&T access but it is definitely worth a try. I think that this is a great feature and I thank Samsung for caring enough to add this, and for Tmobile not blocking my connection, because it\\'s a lifesaver when not around a connection or a hotspot but have school work or something that must get done.**Edit July 24, 2011** Seidio Innocell 3000 mAh BatteryOn the 1620 mAh battery that comes with the phone I was ultimately able to squeeze out 11 hours of usage, from 9:45 a.m to 8:00 p.m, on heavy use. The problem I ran into was that I actually leave my job at 10 p.m, sometimes a smidgen later, and I was not thrilled with having a dead phone to go home with. With that, I chose to get the Seidio Innocell 3000 mAh battery from amazon. I received this battery on Friday afternoon. Charged it from 7:30 p.m to 2:00 a.m Saturday morning. I used this phone from 2:00 a.m until 4:00 a.m Sunday and my phone was still at 4%. This is after over 3 hours of conversation, non-stop messaging, Facebook messages and status updates, internet, YouTube video\\'s for 30 minutes, gaming and using the OI Shopping app when I got off work at midnight and picked up a few things for Sunday dinner at Wal-Mart. Calculate the time: From 2:00 a.m Saturday til 4:00 a.m Sunday I did not touch my charger. I took my charger to work with me just in case and never pulled it out of my purse. That is 26 straight hours of power, and then some because when I went to bed at 4 a.m my phone was at 4% and I could not kill the battery and trust me I did everything I could to kill it because I am still conditioning the battery and wanted to charge it from slam dead. However, I gave in and charged it at 4%. There is no telling how long that battery truly lasts beyond 4% because I had to give up and go to bed and I needed a working phone later in the day and did not want to chance standby and a dead phone when I woke up 8 hours later. Nonetheless, this is an accessory that is really necessary if you are like me and enjoy having the phone all day! This battery is $56.00 here on amazon.com and it\\'s worth every penny! (I did a more detailed review on the battery page and like the phone journey I will be updating that review as I get more of an understanding of what it will be doing over time, especially next weekend when I am done conditioning it.)**Edit August 14, 2011**Less than 2 months after getting this phone it has begun to freeze on me and shut off in the middle of the calls. The dialer is forcing close as well. This was my main issue with the G1 when I had it a few years ago. It forced closed so many times that I was forced to get another phone. I have not found the reason for the freezing and shut off but it has disconnected my calls at least three times this week and re-booted as well as the calls will mysteriously drop with full signal. I am not going to throw in the towel just yet. I will do a little googling and see if maybe this phone is due for an update but if this issue is not fixed soon I will be forced to get another device, which I really do not want to do at this point. For these new issues, I am going to drop this to a three star rating and raise it back to four if I can fix it.**Edit Auguest 17, 2011** Roots and Mobile Access Points, Oh My!Okay, a few days ago I have been having issues with my phone cutting off in the middle of conversations and dropping calls on full 4G signal strength. I went through my settings and realized that I was a \"Super User\". Now, I know that having a \"rooted\" phone does not mean that it will cause the phone to power cycle or drop connection, however, ever since I \"unrooted\" this device I have not had any additional issues with it powering off or dropping calls. For those who don\\'t understand what rooting is, this is a process very similar to taking over administrative rights to your computer, only it\\'s taking over ownership of your phone which allows you to download and install third party applications. The phones from this dealer are rooted and unlocked, so that\\'s something to consider if you start having issues similar to what I experienced.I also just found out that this phone is a wireless access point, which allows you to wirelessly share your data connection through the phone company with up to five additional wireless devices. I tried this last night with my Zune HD and my laptop and it works beautifully. To enable this feature:1. Go to Settings2. Go to Wireless and Network3. Go to Mobile AP (3rd Option)4. Select Mobile AP (1st Option; option will not be active if battery dips below a certain point)5. Activate Wifi on the device you want to use and look for the network, usually named \"Android\" with some numbers after the name.I cannot definitively say that this actually work for carriers other than Tmobile, because I have no other sim cards to test, but it\\'s always worth a shot! Remember that Mobile AP is a hotspot but that it also uses your data so make sure you have unlimited if you plan on using this option a lot. Tmobile has no more than 5GB of data, which is rumored to be unlimited but I don\\'t know because I am somewhat midway through the month and I have used over 2GB of data, so we will see at the end of the month if it is, indeed, unlimited. Excellent seller recommend Keyboard letters too small. Not a good phone excellent arrived, only one critical to the company BLU, the terminal is a little heavy for my taste, but no complaints for Amazon since the package arrived excellent if you\\'re like me and use your smartphone to make calls, text, internet/e-mail ... this phone is perfect! It does not handle advanced games as well as a $700 phone but it runs simple games like Boom Beach easily. Camera does not compare to my wife\\'s HTC M9 but again this is 1/6th of the price. Speaking of price, the phone is cheap enough that you don\\'t really need a case for it... i\\'ve dropped mine more times than i can count and so far no damage; if it does break...i\\'ll just buy another one :-p It is not the International version. Don\\'t buy it Great product! Love Amazon! 👌 Enjoy all the features. Fast,easy switch from my LG g2... nice phone Its a great phone, for calling, texting, pictures and use a few apps. Now, the screen size is a plus, very clear but some times get unresponsive, the speakers for talking are great but to listen music not that great. And the reason I give a 3 stars is the battery, very poor performance, the meter tells you: you have one day of power and in reality last around 3+ hours. for me its a great phone but the battery bad performance over lap the other great features of the phone. If you are into internet, videos, games and music I wont recommend it for the lack of power in battery, if only use for calling, texting, taking pictures in other words, just the basic. then its ok for you. Pros: usibility, battery life, reliability, nice screan, performance.Cons: touch screen screan is not responsive during charging. Phone does not work, it turns off by itself and does not hold charge. Great protection from careless handling. Easy install. Looks great. GREAT good quality Excelente Nice but couldnt fiqure out how to work it so I sent it back Be gusto mucho I was skeptical about buying a used phone online. The last company sent me an iPhone 4 instead of a 4s. So I checked out this company and decided to get the iPhone 5c. The price was the best online. I\\'ve had it for a few months and it works great. It looked brand new. I came very fast. It had a clean esn and was easy to connect to att. I love this phone. I now trust this company and will re-order again if I upgrade to another phone or electronic. Thank-You very much. So many in depth reviews saying almost everything I wanted to say...this phone is really awesome! I am not a Motorola fanboy, actually it\\'s my 1st Moto phone ever, but couldn\\'t resist buying it.Only few points I will emphasize on:-The look: many reviewers kept on comparing this phone with other phones-specs wise, forgetting to put into consideration the size factor! I never had or wanted to have any phone bigger than 3.2\" till I saw the beauty of this RAZR ( & to be honest the GS2 in regard of being slim as well). The phone is a certain conversation starter, looks really cool, well built and definitely not cheap ( and it isn\\'t!)The very new HTC one is bragging to be one of the slimmest phones, well, as slim as it is, it is still bigger than the RAZR!Have been checking most of the phones that are appearing in the market and none could beat the beauty of the RAZR IMO.-the speed: added tons of apps and games, no sweat!-Battery: dunno what other reviewers expected from a phone with such a processor, screen & 4G but this needs power! My last 4 smartphones\\' batteries (in 5 years) couldn\\'t last more than a day, so this one is no surprise. add Juice defender app and it helps u go through the day with moderate use. Some days I talk too much and play too much this is when I need to charge it twice a day, I have a portable external battery that I got off e-bay for around $10. It works fine and is really small.Easier to carry even in pocket.Despite that I actually took one star off cos of the battery and lame camera..at this price range I still expected more from the battery and definitely a more stable cam. U do get better shots when u get to know how to use it, but it could definitely have been better.overall the best smartphone IMO now in market, and will get better with the ICS upgrade in few months. White chips easily. Works well, looks like hell. Very good image Great phone, good price. Worked great for 4 months, then it stopped. The phone will not charge, the power button no longer works, and it does not receive touch input. All in all a waste of $ 275. It\\'s definitely worthy, works like new and the item is in a very good condition!!! Definitely recommended!!! There is a system glitch in the E550a. The company gives you long instructions to fix it but if your not a \"Techy\" it\\'s a pain.. unlocked cell phone kings.remember the name of this company when you buy a phone.I thought i bought a blackberry at a good price because it is an older version.i bought and kept it in storage and i gave it to the person 3 days ago.Boy,this phone is a toy phone.nothing works and everything is plastic.please e-mail at charlessquare@hotmail.com for further details.i contacted the company and see what happens. Excellent Power button would not work the way it should Thanks! Excellent! I love it specially because you can send it to Mexico and it works, just you have to put in the SIM card and that\\'s it, you don\\'t have to do nothin else. I have only been using the phone for 4 months (since it was a Christmas present) and the camera no longer works. It all started with just the front one but now not even the back one works. In addition to this problem the phone starts a weird vibration every time I open an app that requires camera usage (Facebook, Instagram, Snapchat, etc) and it shuts down, the phone turns off. The company should be responsible for this problem. I do not want a refund I want a cellphone that works! The touchscreen did not work at all when I first got the phone. The screen did work for a short time before malfunctioning again. The supplier is sending me a new phone so maybe this one will actually work. It\\'s great except the head phone thing is broke 😔😔 The phone is really good and it\\'s really cool but IF YOU HAVE IT IN YOUR BACK POCKET AND YOU SIT ON IT THE SCREEN WILL CRACK. And the phone is not sturdy at all but the rest is good same thing i like the blu phone but everyone of them have space issue .. nice phone Didn\\'t work with Verizon Sim card as it advertised it would it`s a great phone, very confortable, two line in one movil with android system!!! This phone is everything I wanted and best of all it worked right out of the package for phone calls. I had to call Bmobile in Trinidad and Tobago to upgrade to 4G data for my data to work as my old phone was a blackberry and we have different data plans for them here. Samsung has made me an android convert :)The blue is lovely, I\\'ve only seen it in white here in Trinidad.For those who are on Digicel and complained that the data was locked, call digicel and upgrade to 4G. This is truly an Unlocked phone there is some crutch on the front of the phone . but its work good and i will keep it Phone was purchased for a Consumer Cellular contract. Delivery and price were excellent, and the phone works fine. Product exactly as described with prompt service. I loved every single feature this phone had to offer... The only problem was that highly talked about \"Mobile Carrier\" problem. I had this phone for about a month & the problem of \"dropping signals\" persisted consistently throughout this period with me having no solution that would NOT void the possibility of returning this product.My mobile carrier was continuously dropping for no apparent reason (obv. antennae problem). Other than that the phone was absolutely amazing.But with that being said... Obviously without the ability to make/receive phone calls, this phone was rendered almost completely useless when I was in dire need. clock not working all the time... Very good. ok ok There are some scratches on screen and the phone\\'s back. I do not think it\\'s new at all. Fantastic phone all around great specs for the price Very nice budget phone. I bought this on the Amazon Warehouse deals, the phone came in excellent condition. The phone itself it\\'s good, however Asus would not release a Android 6 Update for the OS. Zen Apps including the UIs are better than expected, I was going to revert to stock android but so far it has be working great. I recommend this phone but at a reasonable price. I paid 150 USD due to its almost as new condition, Definitely happy! I buy the product because I saw that the date of arrival was 6 the same day of my trip but it turns out that the package arrived and thought I should complete that not that good. The product is delivering at 8 front the apartment office but the office is closed 6 pm is crazy Excelente!!! good product, although i had a little issue because of the wifi..... but overall was a good expirience greetings from veneuela not even worked one year, which I got for my son, with so much promise, He is so sad just in one year phone is dead, what sort product you people sell, never buy from you again excelente This is not what I thought this phone was like. I am sending it back for refund. I don\\'t really meet my expectation. Works perfect, just as advertised. It was in pristine condition and packaged very nicely. Wonderful transaction and phone...Thank you! Fantastic seller, smoking fast shipping. I wish everyone did business this way!! This may not be the \"best\" Apple phone but it is amazing. I still like Microsoft based phones and there are pros and cons to both. Completely dissatisfied. Unusable phone, attempted to return, have yet to receive a refund. MUY BUENO,LO RECOMIENDO,ESTE APARATO ES MUY BUENO,HAY QUE LEER BIEN LAS INSTRUCCIONES PARA CONOCER BIEN OS DETALLES Y Y DISFRUTARLO A CABALIDAD Good for some one doesn\\'t want Internet and easy to use phone ... Don expect any thing fancy .. Good phone I got this phone after i had iphone 4 for 4.5 years, so the lg is miles away in any parameter.Love it!! After the camera broke, I decided to upgraded my Samsung S3 I had for 3 years, to this Samsung Galaxy S5...And I love it!Love the camera... very clear and professionalSound is great and the screen res is amazing...And I have been known to drop my phone often... amd sometimes where the moisture content is higher that of the typical tolerance for machanical devices....Thank you water resistance... now I don\\'t have to worry about that... (accidentally tested that feature) Bought this for my daughter, but she did not like it, and it does not appear to function like other smart watches do, so it was returned. It was supposed to be a verizon compatible phone but it was a sprint phone. Very good I ordered this cell phone with the understanding that it was an UNLOCKED US VERSION Nokia 2730 flip phone. What I received was a LOCKED flip phone that was shipped from Singapore. I spent 8 hours at two different AT&T stores trying to get this phone to work....they even replaced my SIM card twice while I was at the store...but to no avail...the phone would not work. I contacted Amazon, and they contacted the seller. I returned the phone for a refund but the clincher is the returned phone had to be sent to Israel which makes me a little uncomfortable since the phone came from one foreign country and had to be returned to another foreign country. Amazon has assured me I will get my money back.....but I guess I will just have to wait and see. The seller did offer to exchange the phone once they received the one being returned....needless to say I was a bit skeptical of this....I feel like the whole thing was a bait and switch. Amazon has been very helpful in this matter....I shall wait for my refund......we will see. It was excellent. Thank you. I\\'ve owned 4 other BLU phones and they were great but this one is by far the best that BLU has ever come out with. one suggestion to BLU is they need to make it like past BLU phones that allowed you to move apps over to the SD Card to free up space and should have included a flash for the selfie camera ( I did find an app for that though) . Otherwise great product. I probably won\\'t have to buy another blu for a few years. they have a few glitches with restarting itself occasionally but overall the best phone I\\'ve owned. Update: 11/18/16. It is now stuck on LG logo screen. I called LG and no warranty since it is international version. Don\\'t buy international version otherwise even if it is manufacturers defect, it is not covered!$400 range, I chose this phone. What made the decision for me is the camera. Very im6pressive camera with manual control which means you can shoot like DSLR. The other options were the Nexus 6 or Moto X pure. I like a lot!! excelente I bought it for a gift. I turned it on and seems to work great. I bought this as a gift using the Virgin no contact plan. The only negative I have is not with the phone but with the plan as web usuage is based on having a Wi-Fi connection which isn\\'t always accessible. Plus the one I was giving this too does not have internest service at her home, so had to use a neighbor\\'s password to connect to the Web. Not real handy. not an original product. its a knock off. I got another phone just like this one at verizon store and realized the difference right away. It feels different this phone bends and cracks much more, and has minor visual differences. the biggest give away is that i noticed that there was a gap at the top of the phone and i could easily slide mi finger nail inside and lift up the screen.... Wonderful phone. Have never had a phone that had this many bars this often. Catching calls now that I would of missed with my Samsung note 3 or 4. Where the Notes had 1bar, the Blu has 3. I have tested this with both samsung notes and a $140. Blu and this Blu. Blu is the winner. Blu has one powerful radio.All the extra stuff you get in the box means you\\'ll not have to buy anything extra except a sdcard.The phone does not have all those extra installed apps on it that you can\\'t remove.The phone moves as fast if not faster than the Notes.I have been a Samsung man for a long time, but now I have switched.The only thing that is less on this phone is the price tag! Nice Phone, Works perfect in south america. I bought this for my dad and he\\'s been using it for 5 days now, and he loves it! I mostly chose it for the battery life since he always complained about with his last phone. I used it for a short time to test the performance and needless to say, it\\'s zippy. No way as fast as my G4, but it gets the job done. I might even get one for when I go camping or for work. Dual sim is very handy. My dad and I would recommend! amazing phone, a compact size, very easy to use, very fast, with many practical functions, I recommend it 100%, everything is very high quality I was cautious about ordering a phone from a second party like this, but I was very pleasantly surprised at the service and the quality of the phone. The phone is very nice. There are no scratches anywhere. It works perfectly. I was also contacted by the company about a week after I received the phone just to be sure that it was received fine. They were very professional. I have recommended them to my friends. Works great I got the phone blocked and now I have to pay $50 to unlock it. It glides on almost every surface...One day i was laying down on concrete floor and my phone slid off my pocket and fell about 3-4 inches before it hit the ground and cracked the screen. BE WARNED, it will slide off of metal, wood and plastic and will brake easily. I love it was perfect when it arrived I had a iPhone 4 this 5s is great very happy. It arrived on time. Would recommend this seller. awful, don\\'t waste your time or money on this Works perfectly. I am very satisfied with the delivery and the quality of the product. I wished there was a phone # I could call to speed up communication once I received the Blackberry. As I had rather do personal research rather than go back-and-forth with e-mails to figure out some of the per-existing setup on that phone.But on the over-all I am very happy with this purchase. great phone Very good! Works great!! This is a fantastic phone. Good value for the price, works fantastic in every way, and the best thing is that it is not insanely expensive. If you spend two or three times as much, or more, you get very little in return for the difference in price. For those that are wondering, this is plug-and-play for Cricket customers. I took the SIM card from my low buck Nokia 635, stuck it in the SIM slot, and BAM... everything worked flawlessly. Only thing I lost in the process was old text messages.A couple of side notes to bear in mind as you are shopping. Get a good case and a tempered glass screen protector. I like the case I bought for it too. Should provide good protection, but not too bulky and without the sticky rubber than turns your pockets inside-out. The tempered glass covers are much better than the cheap plastic film that your fingers stick to and are prone to bubbles. Below are links to the accessories I purchased... very happy with those also.Evocel® LG G Vista [Dual Layer Series] Hybrid Armor Protective Case For LG G Vista (Verizon/AT&T) - Retail Packaging, Slate (EVO-LGGVISTA-SA01)LG G Vista Glass Screen Protector, Dmax Armor® LG G Vista Screen protector [Tempered Glass] Ballistics Glass, 99% Touch-screen Accurate, Anti-Scratch, Anti-Fingerprint, Bubble Free, Round Edge [0.3mm] Ultra-clear, Maximum Screen Protection from Bumps, Drops, Scrapes, and Marks [1 Pack]- Retail Packaging I really liked the case. Fits my phone like a glove. The price was great for an Otterbox. Looks great on my phone. But the problem I\\'m having is I\\'ve had it on my phone less than 2wks & the hot pink gets stained from my jeans or anything it comes in contact with. I\\'m not a dirty person so I\\'m not doing anything special for the pretty hot pink to start darkening. I think it\\'ll only be a matter of time before I have to replace this b/c it looks like crap from the discoloration. If it wasn\\'t for that I\\'d give it 5 stars. But I see myself replacing it soon. I\\'m constantly wiping it off but it doesn\\'t all come off. Ugh :( Good I have used other phones I think I am super unlucky or its the company on my 6 different blu phone and I have had a new issue with each. My husband owns the blu 6.0 hd and loves it... I just ordered my last try with this company cross your fingers.One I had screen issue one I had a Bluetooth/WiFi issue... One dropped calls.... One doesn\\'t have service 1/2 the time and I can not send photos. Each phone in the first 30 days has failed :( Received phone in a speedy fashion and am very happy that I got this phone. Works great. We previously reviewed this purchase as 5 stars with Usale100. We were wrong. The phone was advertised as \"new and sealed.\" When we attempted to register the warranty on this \"New\" phone, we discovered that the phone\\'s warranty expired already because the phone has been registered and used by another person 2 years ago. This phone is neither New nor certified as refurbished. It also looked like it may have been tampered with. Buyer beware!!!!!!!! I am having problems to get some services on my phone from tstt in Trinidad & Tobago, I need information for APN settings thxs Phone came with screen popped out, but still working, and a scratch on the back. A day later, the phone screen was completely popped out. Sending it back as soon as possible. The phone does not works. It\\'s defective or locked. The phone doesn\\'t recognize networks. The box o received was opened. Review for Blu Life 8. I am having trouble with this phone. I have given it almost 30 days and no improvement. The touchscreen is unresponsive on the right edge most of the time. I have to rotate the phone to use the keyboard. The back button at the bottom of the phone does not respond most of the time which there is nothing I can do but close app. and restart. Sometimes the phone closes apps. on its own for no reason. The phone vibrates for no apparent reason. If these bugs did not exist the phone would be great. I was not satisfied at all the phone wouldn\\'t let me download most apps from the play store and YouTube wouldn\\'t play Worke fine with all local operators (I live in Guatemala, Central America). Digital services are fully operative. Do not try to navigate. The browser is useless. Bluetooth connectivity works great with earpiece. Camera is just for fun. I recommend it as a secondary phone. This phone is a beast. Love it. Great phone for it\\'s price The best phone, 100% recomended Phone serves my purpose. Still have not been able to open pictures sent to me , will not download. Instruction booklet was not helpful. I was very surprised to note that this phone\\'s internal storage is only 197 MB which is very low storage space and also there is not enough appson this and I can\\'t download anything because there in not enough storage space. My friend told me he brought a samsung galaxy exhibitand the internal storage is about 1.37 GB, what a difference and he paid $54 for that phone. I am very upset about this purchase becauseI reccomend my friend Andres Solis to purchase this. love it I decided I wanted an unllocked phone and after lot\\'s of searching found Blu. I started out with the Blu Studio 5.0c phone but it was having reception issues and I was not really in love with the feel of the phone. After much debate after returning the phone I decided to give Blu one more shot. So after more research I settled on the Blu Life One in white. I got the phone last week and had it all set up within ten minutes with my ATT sim card I had from the first Blue phone I purchased. It looks and feels great and the reception has no issues on this device. I have to say the extra $50 dollars this phone cost really makes a difference in feel and quality, well worth it. The case for the white phone comes in a greyish black color that looks nice and the screen protector went on easy (I use scotch tape while installing it to help get the lint off screen before placing plastic). When I have moderate to heavy use I do need to charge at the end of the day but if not it stays charged longer.So all in all if you are looking for a phone that looks great feels great works great and is under $200 oh ya and is unlocked I would say to give this option a try! This phone does most of what it is supposed to, but there is at least one time each day when I can only get it to start up by removing the battery or doing that 20-second thing with the Vol - and On key. If it weren\\'t for that, I would be pretty happy with it. Battery could be better, and it seems to hold a high charge for a long time and then drop precipitously. Keyboard seems to be set for typing BELOW the letter. The phone is exactly what it was advertised to be. I have been using it since August, and it is wonderful! Delivered in excellent condition. I would buy from JP Mobiles again without hesitation. I like so much I had this phone for 2 days and it\\'s is a horrible phone. All it does is freeze and runs very slow with apps and the battery life is only like 5 hours Good sale Perfect!! Recomendados! Really good phone.. really good phone for making call and sending SMS.If expect more just buy android. Love the phone received it on May 16th and now it will not charge unless the charging cord is rigged in some kind of way and I know it\\'s the charging port bc I have tried 7 different charging cords and 4 different charger wall plugs. And since Friday has been shutting itself off and on several times throughout the day. So aggravating I bought this phone 2 months after having bought blu life one for the first time and the screen shattered completely so I\\'ve bought 2 phones in the past 6 months. Good Job.! excelente Very great product. Was very nervous about ordering but it was perfect unlocked and didn\\'t look used at ALL. I ordered it on the 14th and got it to days later. Very fast shipping and no hasel at all. Could not receive text messages. At & t store could not get phone to receive as it was unlocked and what they called a \"foreign\" phone (doesn\\'t seem to be compatiable). I am trying to get approval for a return, so far, have not been able to return it. !!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Highly disappointed !!!! Will not purchase from this seller again! Excellent Sold me a STOLEN/REPORTED iPhone. Being honest gets you paid, not taking people\\'s money and phones. Amazing phone, very fast, excellent pictures, HD screen very bright, 5*. Excellent deal, got exactly what was advertised in like new condition. 100% positive experience, thank you. Love this phone even with the WP8.1 update I don\\'t have some of the issues others had. My only complaint is the weight of the phone. A lot of apps didn\\'t work , phone was slow in responding. Couldn\\'t screen shot. Excellent very good product Nice price great product the home key is not work!!the home key is not work!!the home key is not work!!how can i do? Good and cheap choice! How to see the keypad especially if I call toll free # and they asked me to press #.I did\\'nt see the keypad show in the screen.Somebody can help me pls? this phone hasnt been working properly from i got it, and now it does work at all...i have taken it to several shops and no one seems to be able to help. worst by ever!!! If I could rate 0 stars, I would\\'ve!!!I thought I bought this item from Bestseller2013, instead what i recieved was a F7100 (which is just as big and thrice as useless). Once i recieved the product, I emailed the buyer to get an exchange and was told this is what was advertised!!! O.....k, lets start with the specs on the F7100-3MP back camera, VGA front camera, 1.0 dual core CPU, cheap plastic feel, weak flash, bad screen resolution that looked like ever photo was shot from The Fog yonder. I didnt need to see more and sent the manufacturers back their phone. The problem was i HAD to get Amazon involved with their A-Z gaurantee or Bestseller2013 would\\'ve stuck me with crap!!! After the shipping and Handling for this package back to china (which was another 25+ hard earned dollars) I now have to wait 20+ days for them to check for \"extrinsic damage\" and refund my money...All in all a little under $200.00 dollars thrown down the drain and I\\'m hoping Amazon will continue their good cutomer service and help me with the remainder of the situation. In conclusion, if you want the original android, cheap and useless camera, and a phone that will always remind you of a t-mobile prism wrapped in a HUGE Shiny cheap feeling wrap, ORDER THIS, if not, get a real phone from amazon and save yourself weeks of a headache (because bestseller will ensure that) Buenos Días, compre un equipo con el cual no estoy nada satisfecho por que a pesar de que decía que era nuevo el equipo vino con muchas fallas entre las que menciono: la carcasa me vino partida, las conexiones de WIFI y de bluetooth no funcionan, a las dos semana de haberlo puesto en funcionamiento se le borro el software y se le coloco nuevamente, hace poco la pantalla se puso totalmente en blanco, para ser un equipo \"nuevo\" tiene demasiadas fallas very good phone but the seller office equipment in a box from another phone that was not the original motorola, this gives a lot to think for that reason he would not make another purchase I got this phone about 2 months ago and I love it it has good battery life and good and clear calls I love this phone I would get another and the price was good satisfactory I am almost speechless about this phone. It is frigin AWESOME !!!! Good product. used it oversea (TOGO). Works fine but has reception issue. The reception is very week. No connection in rural area compare to my brother\\'s cheap basic phone. LOL Lower rating now, almost one year later. I can not be 4ft away from my phone, it loses connection. It randomly loses connection also. This is happening after i take extreme care of the watch. Battery life is still decent though. I could only image how it will hold up doing activities. Started great but now dying slowly. On the product specs state work with GSM 850 MHz and 1800 MHz which is not true, the factory spec (which I found later) state work with 900MHz, 1900MHz and 2100MHz only,so unable to use it as a phone, misguided info_. On America only work within a few countries_. Please do yourself a favor. DO NOT BUY THIS PHONE. The duos. The camera stopped working within two months of use. I reset the phone. Called Samsung customer service, nothing could be done. The worse thing is I purchased two phone. The camera quality is not good. Good Love it Very nice phone, bought it as a gift for my sister..she loves it All I have to say is. Wow! The battery last all day for me and I am a heavy user. I am always on my phone so the battery is nice. The phone is fast enough and it takes nice pictures not the best but it is still nice thou. Nice phone. Works great very well made. I don\\'t gat may this watch plizz can u tall me whay ITS SO GOOD!! SASDFYGYkygvcjytjytfytyctjtfhayjf! No ? OK BYE. Am not there one using it buh my dad and he says its slick ,smart ,beautiful too so am all in . LOVE IT Great phone and easy Not good the phone start giving me problems after couple days Great conditions!!! I went to sprint service for TWO HOURS so I can activate it and they can\\'t do it because this phone is not for sprint, if I were you I wouldn\\'t buy this phone just save up your money Nice purchase for someone not in need of a smart phone. It also has good text features and a hugh selection of blue tooth device connections. I received yesterday, when I installed the simm (wich is working on other unlocked iphone 4 32gb), I realized that it is not unlocked, because the simm is invalid. I need as urgent to solve this problem. Please help me !!!!! I love apple, and the new iphone 5 is simply amazing, with a processor that never tires, a battery good durability, multifunctionality and versatility, I love it. Got it for a first time smartphone user in their 50\\'s. Had no problem learning the ropes and looks and feel comparable to any $500.00 smartphone. Great product, BLU! Excellent WORST phone I\\'ve ever had. Slow and glitchy and terrible... Excellent phone, fast thin and wonderfull. everything arrived on time. great seller . responsable. It is larger and easier to type upon. Pretty color. Bought wrong SIM card since Verison towers serve my area and Tracfone uses them not AT&T. I misunderstood which was needed in a SIM card because phone isn\\'t to be under a Verizon contract. When I went thru set up on phone I didn\\'t engage Move IOS to transfer data from android. You have one chance and can not go back and transfer data later unless you clear every out and start from scratch . So now I am entering manually many contacts . iPhone needs to let the buyer know. Nice phone Great phone, but one suggestion. If it is going to be sold as \"unlocked\", root the phone so that it is possible to remove all of the original provider\\'s junk. Unlocked or not, it still operates like a phone I would have expected from one of the providers: Apps launch on startup, and run in the background, sucking up resources at every turn possibly communicating with who knows, and without rooting it myself, cannot be uninstalled. If I am paying retail for this, and not through a provider, the buyer is the admin. Make them a true owner. great phone at a great price móvil data don\\'t works with metropcs, sometimes it works, most of them times it don\\'t. I am a very satisfied customer and would highly recommend this seller. It is Good but the Camera is of very poor quality.. It has lot of functions, but sorry to say the phone was lost due to my negligence... I love this phone. Beautiful and amazing to use. The only problem is that after a few days the charger stopped working. It basically refused to charge my phone, or anything else for that matter. Cons: Its okay phone however, not seeing the long battery life it claimed to provide. This is main reason I picked this phone for my son. The prenstalled apps make it hard to set the display for your own personal needs. It does not allow you to delete some apps already on the display. These apps are something my son would never use. It really takes away the hold ideal of having an unlocked phone. If my son didn\\'t really need a phone right now I would probably send it back. Its kind of thick for its size but that\\'s because of the battery that\\'s being used. I did expect that as a needed measure. I have used it to charge another phone yet, so cannot comment on that feature.Pros: The phone looks good in person. So far it seems to load apps and surf the web okay. The camera takes reasonable pictures. These is an editing option which allows you to change the picture somewhat. nice and affordable I bought this phone in anticipation of replacing my very old quad band phone that I use for asia and europe. The price was good, and in spite of the poor reviews I decided I\\'d give it a try. Big mistake. The first one wouldn\\'t hold take a charge, so I asked for a replacement. Same problem. This phone is useless. I guess I\\'ll go to best buy and get one that actually works. Don\\'t waste your money or time, and especially don\\'t waste your frustration on this useless piece of plastic. You need to remove it from your roster. It only gives Amazon a bad name. I\\'M HAPPY WITH MY PURCHASE. ITEM ARRIVED AS DESCRIBED ON AMAZON WEB PAGE. THE PHONE WORKS PERFECT, LIKE ANYTHING HAVE TO GET USED TO ALL THE NEW FEATURES. I SIMPLY PLACED MY OLD SIM CARD, AND PHONE WORKED AUTOMATICALLY. \\xa0When I first saw the Micro X S240, I would have bet money that it was a toy phone for toddlers, letting them emulate their parents and older siblings with their real cellphones. But it\\'s not a toy, it\\'s a full-fledged genuine Android smartphone. Weighing only 1.85 ounces with a 2.4-inch display, it\\'s by far the smallest smartphone that I\\'ve seen.To get the phone up and running, after removing the back of the phone, I inserted a micro-SIM (15mm x 12mm) and an 8 GB micro-SD card into the slots in the sides of the phone. Then I inserted the 650mAh battery. Before using the phone, I charged the battery with the included 5V/0.5A AC adapter, then turned on the phone. Connecting to my home wi-fi was quick. The phone came with about thirty preinstalled apps, and I downloaded and installed about a dozen more apps. Several of my apps required setting up with my user ID and password. Not being familiar with the tiny virtual keyboard that pops up when you need it, I was making a lot of mistakes. I tried using a stylus, but I found that I did better using my finger. Then it dawned on me to connect my Bluetooth keyboard to the phone\\'s Bluetooth, and that solved the problem. Since then, I\\'ve gotten better at typing on the phone\\'s keyboard, but if I had to do a lot of typing, I would use the Bluetooth keyboard. By the way, the little phone has Google voice recognition, which also can save on the typing.The phone came with Android 4.4.2 (KitKat) installed. One of the things I love about Android is that when I signed into my Google account, my phone contacts and Chrome bookmarks synced and were available immediately. The phone uses most of the Android conventions, such as the power/volume down buttons to take a screenshot.The screen display is 432x240 (160 dpi). That\\'s much lower resolution than larger smartphones on the market today, but as a practical matter, I watched some sports and a few videos, and the images were surprisingly viewable for such a tiny display, although the visibility is somewhat dependent on the viewing angle, as I demonstrated in the accompanying video.With a 650mAh battery powering the dual core processor and the 2.4-inch (diagonal) display, I wondered about the battery life. I tested the battery by streaming full-screen video over wi-fi with the sound on low volume, and the battery lasted for 2:50. For typical mixed use of phone calls, web browsing, reading, music, and apps, I expect that the battery will last considerably longer than that. After draining the battery, I used the included AC charger to recharge the phone, which took about 2½ hours.The audio from the tiny speaker on the back of the phone isn\\'t high fidelity by any means, but it\\'s not too bad, considering the size of the phone. With no background noise, the maximum volume is satisfactory, but as with some phones and small tablets that I\\'ve used, you may want to have an auxiliary speaker handy if the ambient noise is high. A set of earphones is included with the phone; the earphone cable has a microphone that can be used for hands-free phone calls.The phone has front and rear cameras. The rear camera is 5.3 MP (3072x1728), with the front camera having 1.9 MP (1600x1200). The cameras have a limited set of camera controls, including autofocus and a 4X manual zoom. The camera also shoots 640x480 video, and you can zoom in or out while shooting. Overall, the cameras are nothing special, but they\\'re okay. (Note: I determined the resolution of the cameras using benchmarking software. The numbers I got differ from those shown in the product description.)As I mentioned, I put a micro-SIM into the SIM slot. It was a prepaid SIM from a service that used T-Mobile in our area. I made and received some phone calls and text messages. The call quality was excellent. I did not purchase a data plan, so I was not able to test the GPS.After I inserted the 8 GB micro SD card, I used the phone settings to make the SD card the default for writing. The phone has 4GB of internal storage memory, and after you account for the operating system and the preinstalled apps, you\\'re not left with a lot of available memory - about 2.5 gigabytes - so don\\'t count on installing hundreds of apps. The micro SD cards are so inexpensive now that it just makes good sense to use one if you want to store a lot of books, music, videos, and apps on the phone. I connected the phone to my PC with the included USB charging cable, and it appeared in Windows Explorer as a USB mass storage device (as did the micro-SD card in the phone). That enables you to drag and drop files between the PC and the phone.I used the Antutu Benchmark app to see how the phone compared to other Android phones, and it scored 10,051. That\\'s very low compared to high-end smartphones which score over 100,000, but it\\'s actually higher than some current smartphone models. I\\'m not geeky enough to discuss the merits of the phone\\'s 32-bit dual core 1.0 GHz CPU, but subjectively, the phone appears in most respects to be fairly responsive.The phone comes as part of a package which includes an AC power adapter and charging cable, and a set of earphones.The bottom line: It looks like a child\\'s toy phone, but the Posh Mobile Micro X S240 is actually a surprisingly capable Android smartphone. It\\'s definitely an eye-catcher. One of my teenaged nieces saw it sitting on a table when her family came by for a visit, and she had a fit wanting it. I may let her have it later, but not until I\\'ve had some fun with it. Okay, compared to a full-size phone, the Micro X S240 is awkward and slow when you\\'re typing on its tiny keyboard, and the small display screen may challenge your eyes, but it\\'s the most portable smartphone that I\\'ve seen, and I have to give it 5 stars for the ingenuity of the designers for cramming so much technology into such a miniature device. And yeah, the \"cute factor\" is off the charts.The phone was provided to me for evaluation. I did not promise to post a review, but I stated that if I did review the product, it would be an honest, unbiased review. Great phone! To change launcher...download new launcher, go to app settings of old launcher, \"clear defaults\" and hit back. You then should be able to select a new launcher... Which is key, cause the stock launcher sux if you hate iPhone system. Love the phone! Get screen protectors even though its gorilla glass3. Enjoy bliss! Excellent team all good, I arrive at its stipulated time. Excellent! It works Well but the pictures from its camera are not the best!It does not take all apps All of my family is a Windows Phone lover.. 4 Lumia 620\\'s + 1 HTC 8X.I liked HTC 8x for better resolution, larger screen, better camera, and slim profile - so I thought of upgrading one of the last remaining \"Blackberry\" with this one. I love the WP8 OS, and I\\'ve been using it since over a year and have had no trouble on any of my devices with Microsoft Updates/Manufacturer updates, etc.This phone arrived just on time, but I immediately noticed the box was not an HTC box. It was a generic box. With self-printed sticker on the box indicating it\\'s an HTC phone. The box contained charger, phone, the sim-card-insert-pin/clip, headphones. No manuals.Also noticed that the screen-protector was not original -- it seemed someone may have removed the original and placed a new phone without much care - and left many streaks/air-bubbles etc.Nonetheless, I turned on the phone, activated it and setup using Outlook account. And phone restarted suddenly -- there was no windows update or anything. I thought may be I did something. I checked through Setup also, and it showed there were no update available. Phone remained on for couple of hours and then it would continue restarting every 2-3 minutes, to a point where it completely died. I could not power it ON.I returned the phone and received the full refund.My opinion of this *particular shipment*: This phone either was not an original HTC, or it was a refurb. Either way, HTC / 8x / WP8 are have never given me trouble until this phone. So again, the problem must be with this particular inventory item.Here is my review of Lumia 620: http://www.amazon.com/review/R22ZF0XAEUDTLL/ref=cm_cr_rdp_perm?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00FP2PE22&linkCode=&nodeID=&tag= Wondersul experience seller is awesome, product is delivered as expected and working perfectly Great product arrived on time and works as supposed to. No good battery die so fast u need to plug in with the charger 24/7 so don\\'t waste ur money This is the worst phone I ever had. Can\\'t see the keyboard cause its not lighted and thats the biggest problem I had with this model I bought this phone and was sent to Miami .My father brought him to Argentina for team use. But is dosen\\'t working. The Please returnar money It\\'s doesn\\'t work in certified refurbished you bought this cellphone and his charger and the phone it\\'s doesn\\'t work When I bought this cellphone I was really worried, because I was buying from Peru. But I was really pleased with it, it works great just what I needed to use in my university, I had no trouble with compatibility with the phone company from here, the only thing that bother me a little is that I cant connect to 4G network but I\\'m not sure if it the cellphone or the phone company! I was expecting to receive it in black, but it was white.However, it was seized by the French customs so I had to pay 109 to take it back.Disgusting!!! Not what is advertised at all, the clip nor the packaging had anything to do with the \"Otterbox\" brand I\\'ve gotten this phone twice. One for my wife and one for myself and both come two days earlier from the date it was suppose to come. The phone itself is wonderful and works great nothing off from it. I recommend to buy this phone from here If you in need of a cheep phone thus will work in a pinch I was really happy with the phone, it was great, but after 3 months of using it the WiFi and Bluetooth connectivity started to fail until it stopped from connecting to all networks.Factory reset or repairing android with PC companion didn\\'t solve the issue.Apparently this is a very common defect. I recommend carefully reading of Sony support forums, just search online for \"xperia zr wifi issue\" on your favorite search engine before buying this. You will find a LOT of complains.Note that my phone was never in contact with water or dropped, flashed or anything else.I recommend carefully reading of Sony support forums (search online for \"xperia zr wifi issue\" before buying this).Sadly Xperia Care is not supporting the warranty outside the U.S.[UPDATE] I managed to send it over to Sony, after explaining the issue several times, the unit was replaced for a new one. I hope it lasts this time. Excellent product and seller worthy A-Star, but the problem lies in the same machine moving and difficult transitions between menusAnd clarity of the screen and the camera is very bad because the screen broke, unfortunately, after installing the battery and this shows that the device must be dealt with Ktaaof with a bomb that is to say a very sensitive device at any impelling unbreakable such as eggThis is my point of view the device in either the seller is excellent and dealing with a very sophisticated I visor This product is a waste of money. The thing only worked for a half a day. The directions make no sense, they are written in an attempt at English. The pedometer is not accurate at ALL. Save your money. DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT! Great phone I was really happy with it except I couldn\\'t get more then 2g on metro or T-Mobile I want to return it but I don\\'t know how Nice Good descriptions, just as said. I use this as a lightweight Wifi enabled music player for the gym. I\\'ve also installed a clubcard app so I scan my gym card with the phone. It\\'s a real head turner! It works really, really well! Works great The two headphone no good works great so far. compares well to expensive phones This phone was awesome until it stopped working. Almost 6 months to the day after I purchased this phone the screen stopped working. It wasn\\'t frozen, it just would not respond to any input. I looked at my options with the seller for return and repair. Nothing. I called Samsung twice and they said that they couldn\\'t help me. Samsung said that the phone was from Australia and that I needed to call Samsung in Australia? Really! Anyway, this phone does not come with a factory warranty and if it malfunctions you\\'re out of luck. Samsung did not offer me a repair option even if I were willing to pay for it. So, I\\'m a little smarter now. First, don\\'t spend this kind of money without getting some kind of warranty. Second, Samsung should be take more responsibility for their product\\'s quality and durability. I understand that Samsung makes millions of phone every year and that a lemmon will sometimes make it to the market but they should take care of customers when that occurs. The Nexus 5x is unlocked, much cheaper and comes with a 1 year warranty and you can buy additional coverage for under $70. I miss a few of the bells and whistles that the s6 had but I love the idea that no matter what the reason, if my Nexus 5x fails I\\'m covered. But, on the other hand there are a few things that the Nexus is better at then the s6. Consumer Reports gave the s6 a test score of 78 and the Nexus 5x a 77. The highest test score was 80 for the s7. Everything about this phone is very good, except one thing. The rear facing camera is disappointing, pictures are far from being good. The front facing camera is very good.Other than that I really like it. Love it!!! Great phone for the price. Good item This phone did not meet my expectations since the phone did not workalso the front screen not working . At times when scrolling photos I don\\'t get to see the images . Otherwise so far no complaintsWill recommend to others Scam Muy Bueno Great phone at a very good price. The battery life (3300 mah) is awesome. Loving it. The phone arrived on time. Works great. My teenage daughter is happy. What else can I say...also a great price. all perfectly I have had mine since February and I love my phone!!! 🙌 Good 💯 EXCELENT THANKS FROM VENEZUELA Excellet Excellent Muy bueno Good phone very new works great Apple is very proprietary. If you can deal with the mass limitations, even between other Apple products, it\\'s a decent smartphone. It is hugely over priced though. Excellent seller 100% recommended it s ok! Thank This is no phone but a plastic toy parked to defraud. Hard to figure out with very little instructions could not have been more pleased the product say \"Nokia Lumia 920 Black Factory Unlocked\", but comes with software in ITALIAN!!!!!... I am right now in Venezuela, am living here, and the phone don\\'t have the spanish language... i hope than update the software of the lumia, add more language, included spanish... i buy some nokia in teh past, E71 and E6-00 wich says FACTORY UNLOCKED, and the soft is clean, in english originally, but i can change to spanish easily... i espected more of this phone, but the saler sad me... So sorry. My first reviews was an error. Thanks very mucho, I and very happy with this phone. I love my Crackberry! Great small phone for the basics calls. Great phone for the price! Bought the unlocked version on my own, independent of any carrier. Using it with Consumer Cellular service. Takes great photos! Nice, simple phone. Great HD screen. Large, yet lightweight. Comes with case, screen protector and charger. Full package at a great price. I\\'m very happy with this purchase. I\\'m sure HTC mini m4 is a great phone, especially its size and it\\'s audio system. I tried to save a few bucks by buying it from a third party vendor over Amazon. What a waste of money.The phone I bought behaved like a non commercial release. It came with Korean apps that couldn\\'t be uninstalled. One of which would play the phone\\'s ringtone in unexpected hours, and for no known reason. Tried to root it in order to uninstall default apps, and made it a brick. Do yourself a favor and spend the extra bucks and but from a retailer. Great phone, everything you need in small size. Just like I want.But when I received it, the box wasn\\'t sealed, but still new.Thx I absolutely love this phone. Feels great in hand, no gliching, no problems and pretty fast compared to the phones i have had in the past. I would definitely recommend this phone. It \\'s a excellent product I love this thing! I had the Samsung Galaxy s3 mini and this blows it away. It is a little larger, which I would prefer it to be the same size, but oh well, can\\'t complain too much. When I turned it on, It asked for a pin, so I had to look up how to perform a factory reset and that took care of the issue. It is an international, so it has a funky wall plug but that\\'s okay. Also, you\\'ll have to play with the settings so you can actually understand the language. screen will scratch eventually, even with very little use. probably good to get a protective screen. other than that I like it a lot It worked for a few days and since then will not. Tried everything. Called verizon for they help also, but no luck. Now doesn\\'t even recognize there is a battery that is fully charged in the phone. Great phone in every way. Fast, smooth, takes great photos (way better than my previous nexus 6p), extremely well made and just beautiful. I didn\\'t buy this to use as a phone, I bought it as a replacement for a sandisk clip player. So the review is on this aspect.I got the phone. Signing in was a bit annoying with a tiny keyboard, but still doable. I went and downloaded poweramp. I also bought a small clip for the phone and I used a 64 gig micro sd card with music on it.Poweramp works fine. It took forever to build the database of music, but after that, it was great.The charger problem is true. Some of my cables work, some don\\'t. Anything with a fat head on it, isn\\'t going to work.I used a pair of headphones with media controls on it, and they work fine. Able to switch tracks on it with no issues.Overall, good. 1 star less for the cable issue though. And for the love of god, please someone make a hard rubber case for this phone with a clip built in!UPDATE:Ugh. After just 1 week with it, it broke. No longer powers on. Trying to contact Posh about it. Will update. I like it but only complaint is batter excellent phone. ! good reception , good graphics and perfect working demo in Venezuela . I recommend it for the price value . I loved the phone but 4G isn\\'t supported in the US for this phone and that was a deal breaker for me. I even contacted Samsung Customer Support and they couldn\\'t help with this either. Sad that I had to return it. Ok I love it! Especially, the duos sim cads. Great phone at a great price. This is a phenomenal idea. I actually keep three cards in mine, and I hope to never go back to digging through my pockets for my credit card or carrying a wallet. The only problem is that I\\'m on my fourth case in probably a little over a year. The tiny plastic hinges that hold the door on tend to break if the phone is dropped, even lightly. Otherwise, great product. This case fit the phone just fine but the holes for the two speakers are way off. It completely covers the back speaker and the small hole where you talk. I would not recommend this product. I purchased 2 cases, from two different sellers. The other case I purchased was great. It was the BLU ArmorFlex PC+silicon case for Studio 5.0C HD - Carrying Case - Retail Packaging - Neon Pink+Blue. It fits well and is comparable in color and style of this one. Good size but freezes all the time. Received the phone after waiting 2 weeks when it was released was and SUPER excited after it was on sale for 85 bucks! I had to buy it! There is a lot to talk about lol The phone has 2 SIM cards, Slot 1 is for 4G and 3G signal while Slot 2 is 2G next to the battery which you must removed to access. Dont forget the SD card slot. Battery life is great it lasts me to the end of the day just from texts, videos and web. The screen is awesome 5.5 inches, 720p goodness! I have big hands and it is still hard for my thumb to reach to the corner of the screen, capacitive buttons to squeeze out more size I would assume. Volume buttons and the power button are located on the right side of the device, headphone jack on top and charger port on the bottom. Weight on the phone is okay though it is not balanced very well, there have been times where ive had the phone go over my index finger. (Big hands) The camera is okay 8MP with a LED light to accompany it. Front camera is 2MP which I dont really care for unless youre a selfie person or for skype for pictures youll be using those filters to help the image quality lol. The back speaker is a bit too loud in my opinion. Great phone for the price! Bloat-free, I have rooted the device with Kingo Root. Now the bad stuff oh boy..BAD!1. The smartphone did not attempt to read my 32G SD card, Ive tried MANY cards on the device and nothing. I asked for a replacement for the dead SD slot which came in to days woo! Grabbed the new replacement aaaaaand IT DID NOT WORK! Really frustrating since I have tons of music on those cards.2. On both devices Ive had the same problem. The battery seems to be picky about what phone charger can and CANT charge it! What the...3. While charging, the top half of the huge screen becomes unresponsive! Bringing down the notification bar at the home screen is almost impossible while charging. (Maybe its the voltage coming into the device??)4.So MANY bugs on the UI, such as the swipe lock screen. I touch the bubble swipe to the right and the it unlocks and locks immediately! to access my home screen I must go through my notifications bar and menus menus menus. Another example, the dial pad, dialing numbers lags really bad.5. Im not sure if it is specific apps (YouTube etc.) or the wifi hardware, but while watching 720p videos they seem to buffer too often. Making HD videos almost unwatchable. It could be the 4.4.2 KitKat OS that is contributing to 95% of these problems and hopefully they will be fixed with the 5.0 Lollipop upgrade which the ETA on that is unknown. Otherwise its a GOOD starting phone with decent specs but if problems continue to arise I might will return this phone and spend 75 bucks more for a better upgrade. I could bump to 4 stars if 5.0 Lollipop comes in. I would recommend the Smack Its a great phone Gloria Thanks VB After reading several reviews i decided to buy the phone and test it out. I activated on AT&T network and all the APNs were automatically setup. I am getting 4gLTE speeds. Just like other reviews stated it does not have an app drawer i tried to use the google launcher but did not like the functionality. I instead opted for nova launcher and really like the options it gives to customize. I tried to download apps from the amazon app store but it kept causing my phone to crash to i stuck to just downloading apps from the play store. there has been no lag even when running several apps at once. It does have a great speaker that is really loud. Item was clearly used, as it arrived in a torn box with an extra charger and headphones that were not listed in the items included on the side. Device was also fully charged and running the latest software update available. It is, however fully functional and in good condition. awsome phone A1 products Seems to be as described and in great condition! Arrived on time But without promised case and the sync cord was super cheap but I didn\\'t really buy it for that purpose. The phone is very good and that is certainly what counts! Phone looks great and works great A great phone. Sleek and fast. Arrived on time and in the expected condition in original box and factory unlocked. Great memory expansion up to 124GB. Sharp screen. Very pleased! this phone is a good phone it does support 3g h+ at practically 4g speeds with atnt in USA and has a good screen it\\'s touch screen isn\\'t the most sensitive but just use regular screen protector don\\'t use tempered glass protector regular one works much better it is a good phone but you need to have software version A916_S1205_141013 either installed using custom recovery zip flashed or scatter loaded using mtk MT6592 flash tool on the computer because if you don\\'t do it then youtube may not work and system will be laggy and if you do the research you will find the phone number that activates the ability to have 2 sim cards at the same time so pretty much if you know what your doing then buy this phone but if you don\\'t then pick a different phone to purchase fortunately my lenovo a916 works good after doing research just takes patience It\\'s OK. Unfortunately it doesn\\'t work like the one it replaced. Got it for my grandson to replace one he lost. The watch works well camera so so music plays ok. You must have a sim card for for everything else to work . His other one would cannect to his ear piece and Facebook and Internet without a sim card. Had to amend the review. 1 It only has five faces to chose not many and when playing music the battery died in less then one and a half hour. Haven\\'t figured out how to make it work yet. For the price, which at my time was $39, this is about as \\'smart\\' as it gets. The internal storage is garbage, and the 512 MB ram really (as of 2016) puts it in the child\\'s toy category, but if for some reason you need a really, really cheap, basic Android capable smartphone, this is the one. Of the 4 GB of internal memory that you get, less than half is usable, because Android itself takes up most of the space. Many people agree that Android really starts taking a hit if you make it run on anything less than around 512 mb internal storage free, so that basically leaves you with like 1 GB for documents, apps, music, movies, etc. There IS an expansion card, however, with 4.4/KitKat not all apps are able to be moved to external storage, so most of your apps will still need to reside within phone memory, unless they do some kind of update which isn\\'t likely from either Google, at this point, or even less from Blu. They do not support their phones very well, this is not the first Blu phone I have bought. I\\'d almost bet you 10 bucks that you will NOT be getting 5.0, or anything really from Blu, on this phone, pretty much ever, unless you root it and do it yourself. Not worth it, anyway. I bought it for a friend of mine that came to visit from Europe and found out that they couldn\\'t use a prepaid sim with their phone. They needed a cheap smartphone that could take a prepaid card, so that they can check their email and use the Uber app -- for that purpose, the phone performed well. excellent User friendly, technologically sound. I am someone who does not want a Smart Phone. I like the Link because it\\'s compact, the keyboard is easy to use, camera is decent, has speaker phone feature, blue tooth adaptable; I\\'m totally satisfied. I tried the Alcatel which looks like the Link but it\\'s an inferior phone. This is a great phone and the price is awesome. Especially since AT&T is selling it for twice the price and if you get it through their next program it\\'ll cost more. My only negative thing about this phone is the color of the pictures. They have a pinkish/reddish light to them no matter how you adjust the settings. If it weren\\'t for that I would have given it 5 stars. very good This is the best phone I\\'ve had the opportunity to experience. It is very practical in it\\'s function and ability. Having the functionality of a phone and larger viewing area has allowed me to move from a phone and tablet to this one great device. The phone was clean barely showed signs of usage excellent condition I took this phone to the Verizon Store and already have an account. I was unable to get my email accounts added to the phone. The phone looks great; however, it is difficult to understand, and I have Windows 8.1 on a laptop. The phone was extremely hot as I charged it. I would not recommend it. It just has one camera and with low quality nice for its price Awesome solid phone, screen is nice, I changed the launcher to Google now launcher the instant I got it, to give it a stock feeling and the battery life is awesome Good phone for the price.. Im Happy with it Excelent too beautiful all good nice, better than I spected GOOD It\\'s pure junk get a gear at least it will charge cheap is as cheap does that what mammie used to say Love it!!! good basic pone... Works very well with companies in Venezuela (Movilnet, movistar and digitel) Great mp3 player! Excelente I live in Ecuador and it work perfect, it\\'s unlocked. I never had the iphone 6 so I can\\'t compared which is better but this cell phone is amazing! I am very successful and very thankful to have this magic and fantastic product, beause this is made of first hand materials I bought this phone it\\'s works well, but i have to buy an unlock code to use it on the other carriers. After using it for less than 5 months the phone just died. The screen flickered for couple of minutes then went totally black. I hear the phone starting and turning off. This is really a piece of junk. Stay away Excellent Have had posh microx for a day now. It is not going to replace your full size android phone. No app drawer, cannot uninstall some apps. No weather widget available except native, closest city 50miles away. That being said, amazing for the 30$ I paid. I have lots of smartphones. Doesn\\'t compare with my note or fire phone. Would say it is about as good as my Alcatel c1. Other than the pros or cons of being super small. I would say its a solid low end android phone. Fantastic phone ...... So glad I bought it ..... Thinking of another one for my spouse Ordered a Samsung A3 and received a Nokia Lumia....dissapointed... Love the phone. Had it about a month now. Upgraded from the Galaxy S6. Only issue was with seller. I ordered a black S6 Edge + Plus International in the color black. I received the right phone but in the color gold. Also I noticed the info sticker on the box was covered with a new/different model #, ssid#, & different color then what I received. However all the #\\'s & info on the bottom under the \"new sticker\" matched my actual phone. Other then that all is great. It came in. I charged it. Inserted my AT&T mini Sims card, put in all my info to restore my stuff from my Samsung & Google accts, and it even downloaded the apps I had on my regular S6 so I didn\\'t have to do all that again. Thank god! Lol. It can be a pain setting up a new phone. Took me about an hour to charge and completely setup. 35-40 mins to fully charge the battery. Great I\\'m very disappoint with this product! I received another Samsung phone that is not this one!... And to add, the product has a very bad quality, it\\'s extremely slow and the battery got bulged in just 3 months. I have been asking for this battery and everybody say that this is a Chinese battery and it isn\\'t from the Samsung, so for that it got damaged like that. Happy with purchase after having used the phone for a week. Fully functional and decent speed on AT&T network. Amazing what Posh was able to do with such a small form factor. Very light too.Works well for calls, with good quality sound. Of course typing is a challenge on such a small screen, but that\\'s to be expected. Sending short texts and e-mails is the name of the game. Only complaints are that removing the back cover is a real pain and, as others have noted, the charging cable micro USB has a long tip. You can find a few to buy on Amazon, but these tend to be pricey. Overall, quite pleased with the phone and its value. was not locked to Sprint as stated i bought because in the page said that it works with 4g in argentina. that is false. touch screen stopped working after three weekswon\\'t buy another one Nothing great about this. Low quality resolution. It is worth ok $100 range. Beyond that better off with anything else. The phone specs are great. If you are coming from Samsung or even a Sony Xperia then the UI will need a small degree of learning curve.Pros:Great specs for the price, especially 4gb ramNo bloatwareCons:Battery fully charged barely lasts 24 hoursUI needs some learning curve on the user\\'s partBy far the biggest drawback - Speaker output is horrible and can be best described as low energy and anemicI ended up returning mine due to the battery and low speaker output. Otherwise, the phone for the price is a bargain. IT was what i expected, and delivered fast. this was for my wife and she loved it. I would recommend this product to others. I\\'m an Android person and love the HTC Droid Incredible 2. This is my 3rd Incredible 2 and I will hate to have to change phones when it is not longer available! Excellent product Very disappointed. Pre ordered the white with 16/2 IM/RAM. Waited weeks for delivery only to be told it was not availabIe. I ended up getting the white with less memory only to see the dark blue with increased memory available afterwards.Overall I thought it was a good phone from BLU but..... Battery life not great. Had phone for more than a week and the battery has to be recharged every day. 4G LTE a must. Really makes a difference. I had the Blu Energy X Plus before, love the 5.5\" screen and 4000mAh battery but it was not 4G LTE.BLU can\\'t seem to get it just right.5.5\" screen, 16/2 memory, 4G LTE and a 4000-5000 mAh battery. Every other possible combination is available. Come on BLU get it right.1 Month Update - This phone has a tendency to just reboot itself at random. It will not receive MMS\\'s unless you clear/delete other MMS to /from other contacts. I guess the memory fills up so quickly. Overall this is a real piece of GARBAGE. I would not buy this phone. Stay away. Great Smartphone. Had it for a month now with no problems. Battery lasts almost 2 days without a charge. Upgrading to Android Marshmallow was easy. Takes great pictures, even in low light. Works seamlessly on ATT network. Great phone. GOOD DEAL.ARRIVED IN TIMELY FASHION Outdated and palm doesn\\'t even host the server to register it to. It was a worthless purchase. I wish there was negative stars. The telephone works perfectly as all his accessories. Excellent price and quality of the product. Totally satisfied the experctativas. Very advisable. Pretty good for the price If anyone is interested to know how the 7 performs compared to the 6 and 6sCamera is a little better and you notice it for sure. It is a lot better in low lights conditions.SPEED, I was using a 6s and I notice a much snappier Safari and iMessage screens. Part of it may be IOS 10 but pages pop really fast. It is way way faster than the original 6.Black looks awesome!!! But is is so slick. There are no lines and it looks like a solid 1 piece product. I saw the Glossy Jet Black and it is a work of art but it show fine scratches. So most people will use a case which hides the back anyway so maybe color is not that important. Mainly if you want a white front or black.I love the new home button, took about 5 minutes to get use to and I don\\'t miss the old home button at all.Any case with a large camera cutout like the CM4 wallet case works with the 7. But most likely all other will not. Some of mine I can cut out around the old camera hole and use it until new cases come out. But I promise you this phone is slippery when dry!!Overall I love it! Fastest device that I have ever used. I can out type the 6s sometimes on reviews but thiamine keep up no problem.128g is perfect in size for most everyone. Hardcore photo and video people may want the 256g.No headphone jack, doesn\\'t bother me at all. The adapter sounds fine with my expensive headphones. It\\'s not really that large either. The lightning headphones sound really good to me. I tested the same song with the same headphone using a 6s and the 7 with the adapter and I cannot tell the difference. In some ways the 7 with the adpater sounded cleaner and had a little less aliasing hiss from the analog to digital conversion process. So beside have a little while cable sticking out I think the 7 audio is fine.IPhone 4,5, 5s, SE and 6 users will feel a huge speed increase. The 6s is not far off speed wise but it is noticeable to me.No matter how you split up the payment or go with a upgrade contract price, you\\'ll pay full price for any of the phones. It is all just creative math by the vendors. I bought mine outright and got point on my credit card, enough to reduce my price by $25.00. I also heard the Black and Jet Blacks maybe high in demand.Hope this helps :) So nice phone and very cheap Love it This is the worst phone I\\'ve ever had....software glitches...shuts off n won\\'t come back on....sensor for talking is bad...n I\\'ve only had it a month..don\\'t waste ur money!!! Great for what it is and offers, can\\'t beat it for 30 bucks LOVE very nice phone The phone is horrible Everything Ok! 100% Advisable! very good I am in love with this phone! I bought it in gold...shipping was right time. Battery life is great if you are a light user. If you are a heavy user like myself, you will have to charge at least once for the day. I bought this for my dad. It got delivered really fast and in great packaging and the phone works great. Can\\'t even tell its been used. He loves it. 5 stars Purchased the phone because it was said that it\\'s compatible with Straight Talk. Just a waste of money. Lovely and exciting I love my phone, the camera takes wonderfull photos. the battery whent dead after three months but I guess it\\'s a BB\\'s problem and not from the seller Simple GSM works as expected...nothing fancy...display and sound is good. Easily support any GSM sim worldwide The shipping was great and I got it ahead of time but I am a Go Phone pay as you go user and the phone wasn\\'t compatible; the battery ran down as I watched, from full to zip in just minutes. I returned the phone for a refund because it was defective. A better product for a younger crowd? Yes, I think so. speedy delivery but the ear piece is vey low and charger stopped working after two weeks. i bought i phone 4 and this i phone supposed to be used like new but i surprised when i found the back camera is scratched and not working , really it was very bad It worked gr8 The Sony Xperia Z3 must be the smartphone world\\'s best-kept secret, seriously. This is superior to the Samsungs I\\'ve owned.All you Samsung suckers out there should give the Sony Xperia line a look. I love the phone. Its beautiful and feels nice in the hands too. a lovely upgrade from the iPhone 4S Received this phone from warehouse deals. Everything admittedly worked except the most important thing, the SIM card slot. You would put in a sim and it didn\\'t recognize it. I have returned so Amazon so now I\\'m waiting on my refund I have to send it back There was some initial confusion with this phone, however I have since learned that it wasn\\'t necessarily the sellers fault.They have gone above and beyond to help remedy the problem we encountered with the Sprint phone.They have opened up a line of communication and are doing everything possible to have a satisfied customer. Great phone. ME GUSTO Fantastic product, arrived in time and everything was factory sealed. I wish the battery lasted longer, but that\\'s another story. Excelente I have been using this phone for 3 weeks now and it is GREAT! No joke, this phone works perfectly and is fast. No complaints except you can\\'t buy a lot of covers. A cover is included and works fine but you don\\'t have many choices other than that. I plan on buying another phone for my son.... Excellent! I like it! Love It ... Great phone. Very rugged. This phone looked like good deal until I received it. Cosmetically the phones looks ok. Feels sturdy. The main issue I had with it is that the screen looks grainy. Youtube videos were hard to watch due to the low screen resolution and had a slight delay. According to the Sales Guide from BLU, this phone has a resolution of 480x854 and 196ppi, did not see that spec before ordering the phone. I had so much hope for that phone......size was good and comfortable but screen quality wasnt good,i wish i would take risk and buy more cheaper phone even blu hd 5 and yezz andy 5m had a more clear screen quality I got the phone yesterday...trying to switch on, was not turning on, so I left it for more than 12 hrs charging, and still not working...what do I have to do?? DISASTER... Friendly and easy to use. I bought this phone to my wife, after a very deep research about pros/cons and other consumers comments.I used for about 2 weeks and then my wife is using it for more than a month, without any problem. She is not a \"friend of technical stuffs\", but she is operating some functionalities without problem and every day she shows me something new that she learned by herself. This means that Symbian is very easy to understand, learn and follow.The double keypad/keyboard is very good and the camera better than the E71 (my phone).GPS works fine almost all the time (faster to initialize than in the E71).The only 2 cons:1- apparently the wireless antenna is in the top of the phone, so when you are browsing, writing with the extended keyboard, the left hand normally is over the antenna and the wireless signal is not good at all (usually loose connection)2- the memory slot cover was made with plastic (the E71 is with rubber) and if you have no enough care (or long nails) probably you will damage it and then will be very difficult to open. Great phone foe the price. I\\'ve had no problems and everything has been running without issue. This is my second posh so I decided to go with the larger screen. Easy to see and I even read books on it. EXCELENTE My brother love it I love my old htc sensation. I drop that one and the screen got broken. I decided to buy the same one because it was so inexpensive! Well, the camera works but I can\\'t make videos... so that is why it was so inexpensive? good phone and for the price the phone is great. worked perfectly with tmobile. will be buying another for gf. Good. Recommendee for y\\'all androids user This (China\\'s) product fell apart after around 3 months of use. Phone is working fairly ok but with some noise sometime. Belt fell apart due to the nature of plastic.The belt is anchored by plastic anchor hidden inside of belt and was torn apart after sometime. Although lots of time plastic / rubber belt of any type of watch would break, this one is exceptionally bad.The back cover deformed after a while.Please see attached image.When request warranty, the seller pushed this to Amazon and attempted to reject the warranty process.Bluetooth is not working too great to auto-reconnect. You simply have to manually connect Bluetooth. Excellent horrible keyboard and it broke after a month GREAT My original atrix had a busted screen. The cheapest fix was $160 bucks (the screen is part of the display and have to replace both at same time). I figured i would take a chance on this phone for the price. I am SO glad I did. The phone had NO scratches on it (i was surprised to be honest) and worked as new! We have only had it a few months now but I have had no problems with it at all. My husband has had his for over a year and drops it about once a week (roughly a 6 ft drop) and it still holds up. There honestly was no difference between this one and a brand new one. Would buy again! Came with charger and headset, no memory card, really nice phone hi, my phone isn\\'t work the screen was balck and not working more. the suport htc online said thas is a Test equipment and he can\\'t market. the IMEI is a test equipmet. Iwant my money to return :( Perfect. Delivered early. No problems whatsoever. Bien poor qualitydo not reccomend buying this producthad faults and had diff back coververy tacky over all . It Stopped working after few months. I did not even bother to return it. There are much better phones out there than this one. That\\'s great Product worked well for 1 week, after that, back button start to “ghost pressing” ,first only few times (causing apps closing) and after few hour I can’t use the mobile anymore. Now when you open an app, it takes only few seconds to close due to back button problem,. Its now seven days since I receive my new phone. .unfortunately it NEVER yet vibrate plus it works only for the very two days I first got it...not impressive at all....I try to reach customer service for help questions but unsucessful... I really appreciated the phone Terrible thing! It takes big knife or screwdriver to open battery cover. People who are married with their phones can probably guess how it opens, but manual does not describe it. Tried many tricks, big knife was the only successful. Will throw it away, to cheap to return. The device doesn\\'t work , I will be returning it . Great phone I ordered black, got platinum instead... Nice for price I\\'m very satisfied with my purchase Better than expected . . . It is very good. and easy to use. Contains apalicaciones good and excellent space for storage. Ofrece una buena experiencia. It disconnects with no warning and no reason. The phone can right beside of the watch and it will still disconnect Very satisfied, Exactly how it was described. The cutest android! I love it I would have given it a higher rating, but I had to get a SIM card Holder installed on the Phone. Other than that the phone seems to be working fine. Phone is in very good condition and was well packaged. Product OK Totally in love with this phone what can i say works fast both cameras work wonderful just love it......Using in the Caribbean (Barbados) Great Seller. Super Piece. Battery lasts for 2 days without charging and with extensive use. Features in the Note3 are also far better than what its done before. even the search feature in settings makes it so easy to look for anything you want. all OK, thanks a lot I took it to Haiti to give it to someone it doesn\\'t work, I need to return it, please So far I really like this phone, have no complaints yet. Keeps blacking out they sent me 2 ...both did the same thing ..my daughter was disappointed Extremely disappointed that this was received the first part of September and the screen is literally falling out of the phone. I\\'ve never seen anything like it before. My son saved his hard earned money to buy this product and not even 3 months later it is junk. Hope to find someone that can help us to get it fixed. :(Just took the phone to get fixed today and found out the phone is total junk! The battery is swollen and ready to explode. The parts inside were broke and some screws were missing. I watched the man open the phone and was in total shock! I can\\'t believe we were scammed so badly. This was NOT a new phone! I\\'ve had the original Moto G for years and love it. When the 4G came out I was reticent because of reviews alleging a heat problem. I decided to get a 4G plus. At first I was a bit put-off by the larger size, which doesn\\'t feel as comfortable as the smaller G. I also noticed that the unit indeed warms up occasionally, when using the camera. After awhile I got used to the size, and came to really appreciate the larger, high rez screen. The camera is excellent. Audio can sound a bit tinny if too loud, but that\\'s a minor complaint. Build quality is excellent. Overall a great phone. after 3 years of android becoming worse and more locked down with each new version, I switched to apple and after 3 months on ios I can\\'t believe how much I was missing in terms of stability and it \"just working.\" No more Android for me. Not even two weeks passed that the phone broke down. I doesn\\'t hold the charge;it doesn\\'t charge at all thru the USB port.Took the phone for a revision on a local shop and they told me that the mini USB port was broken.The only way that I could use the phone is to buy an external battery charger and a second battery. It solve the problem of using the telephone but as you can inmagine , It will not ne able to synch with the BB Desktop Software if the phone needs and upgrate of OS.Very dissapointed that this happened. BEWARE!!!Dont buy this fone. It might look to you as a new fone but has been tampered with. I took it to Apple and they verified that its still locked to Verizon which is CDMA. Also they confirmed that this fone is showing a purchase date of 1978 which is completely wrong. So this fone has definitely been tampered with. No Warranty.I would suggest not buying this fone. Apple gave all the details to me in writing and said that this fone doesnt come under any warranty. Be careful this is not a LTE version. Just 3G. Drained battery and software and app couldn\\'t link up watch. Frustrating... great phone, working well! Very good. Works perfect and works on AT&T no problem very good thanks The features of this phone meet my needs; its 4G speed makes receiving email effortless, web browsing a snap, and of course receiving clear voice calls. The phone is an excellent choice for anyone considering a smart phone. This phone has a nice large screen, camera is good, speaker is phenomenal. The phone is pretty (not important but still worth mentioning). It comes with a protective case that is color coordinated to the phone. It comes with a screen protector. This phone is absolutely wonderful especially for the low price. I would definitely recommend this phone, and am considering buying another as I bought this for my daughter. If you are budget minded and want a nice phone for a pay as you go or no contract plan this is the ticket!!! works great. no issues to speak of . arrived quickly and as described It is a decent phone for a decent price. Shipping was good. The phone is not the greatest but thats not the sellers fault its the creator of the phones fault. Shipper was easy to deal with. I would rate the seller. 10 out of 10 Would not recommend In 1 month it doesn\\'t work anymore I am exceptionally pleased. Every feature works perfectly. It far exceeds the one I purchased years ago. Kudos to PGD. Its awe always freezing up on me. Ands it slow to open up the apps, its even slow opening up the phone to make a phone call. This phone sucks. Wish i never bought it. Perfect phone for the price I just needed a simple phone for a trip from the US to Jamaica. I know a phone with a sim card was needed so I got this one. It came with a charger unexpectedly (unfortunately the charger didn\\'t work), but the phone worked so thats what matters. The product was excellent. comes with a bad USB cable + Charger. but the seller send a replacement ASAP. it was a new phone. very good I bought this phone and jus 17days after, the phone can not read my sim card no more. The phone freezes all the time, it is just crazy.\\xa0Samsung S5830 Galaxy Ace - Unlocked Phone - Black Very fast shipping. Love it! Very good Love how loud speakers are. I can listen to audio books all day while doing my work. The amazing amount of memory means I can download sooooooooo many apps and not run out of space. Pictures, videos, audio books. This phone is compact compared to a computer yet does almost as much. Perfect everything I\\'m super happy thank u Works great I love it I couldn\\'t be happier with this phone and the seller was awesome they answered all of my questions before I decided to purchase and I am very glad I did purchase from this seller Great buy the phone is just what i needed. its a lot faster than my last phone.i have most freinds with iphones. fast delivery.thank you really good, glad I purchased it. The phone works well. My only issue is memory - the phone memory is not sufficient to support normal usage. It might have been OK when the phone was first released, but not based on how large applications are in 2013. The memory is so limited that you cannot update any of the standard apps on the phone (i.e. those that you cannot remove without superuser access). For example the phone will not be able to support the latest Google Maps and Facebook apps. In order to leave some memory for WhatsApp, I had to prevent GooglePlay from updating any app on phone.Once you get over the memory issue, the phone works well and has good reception (in NYC area). Has been great phone for my 15 year old nieces first smart phone. This phone has not performed to expectation. The touch screen does not sense motion well. It has a very slow processing speed. After less than 18 months, I had to replace because it no longer worked. Save your money and buy another model! For the price it\\'s a good buy. Excellent Deal. Arrived on time, we\\'ll protected and new Package Nice case for the money... works great i\\'m from trinidad an it works on my carrier This phone was locked when I got it even though it says un-locked. This product is terrible glitches and will work not my straight talk data The phone looks like it was brand new, everything works perfect, no dents, no scratches. The shipping was really fast, arrived before time (USPS). also it\\'s great that it\\'s unlocked, it works perfect with my Mexican carrier (telcel), and I\\'m pretty sure I won\\'t have problems using it in the US with t-mobile. very good I have had the lg optimus which was great and then i went to what i thought was a better phone (motorola triumph) it was not. This samsung is by far the best 4g cell phone out there for virgin mobile i have no complaints! The 4 star is because wierdly, some of the apps i.e.: texting, the microphone does not appear for voice to text. One must type everything. For fat fingers, that\\'s difficult. Also, with the microphone option, it\\'s much easier and faster. So that is disappointing! We will contact support to find out if there is a solution.Something like the S5 non-mini, but a much different product. We needed the smaller size. I did like all the features and it worked pertaining to calling but the earphone volume was too low and I didn\\'t find a method to increase the volume. This is all is didn\\'t like on the phone and it was a necessity for me. It\\'s a really good phone better than I expected I updated the Windows Phone, installed a lots of apps... and it worked great!... Graphics and tools were very useful... But suddenly, a reboot loop started, there is no way to stop it! The overheat damaged the microSD, so i replaced it, but the phone is not fixed yet. So i should try with a new battery (10$) because the official support can\\'t do anything for me. I purchased 2 of these phones for my kids and after just a few weeks, they are already complaining that the phone freezes. They have to remove the battery and sometimes reset the phone to factory settings to get it to be responsive again. Not sure if it needs some updates or if the hardware is just not good. If anyone else has encountered these issues and has any fixes or work-arounds please let me know. Otherwise I will continue to troubleshoot and see if I am able to come up with a fix. This product for the price it\\'s going at is very good surprisingly. The build of it feels very nice and has good weight to it as does the apple watch. It sucks that the screen isn\\'t HD, but, then again nothing under $100 on a smartwatch does, at least to my knowledge. The strap feels good in the hands and can probably last you a couple months, or years, depending on how well you take care of it! Great phone for the money! You can upgrade the memory with a micro SD card 128G! I think that it is so because as with some other things we can find now, it was designed to give full capabilities, ruggedness, and long life to persons in non-first-world countries. Thus the replaceable battery, the full set of bands and great performance of Motorola\\'s most up-to-date designs, and even the size, which is comfortable and large enough.I\\'ve found performance to be excellent, all around an area which used to be somewhat fringe on a good Sony feature phone. The 4G is flawless with T-Mobile, when I want to pay for data by an add-on pass to my $3/mo pay-as-go plan, and it\\'s fast -- twice my cable internet.Running on wifi, I\\'m surprised to find that even watching a film is satisfying, and the sound with good earbuds is rich.Calls and receiving calls and SMS can be entirely free on wifi, not using your minutes, if you are careful to understand setting up Google Voice and Dialer. Just be sure to understand that you don\\'t want forwarding to the phone when using this mode of Google services, or they would go on your plan minutes.. Get someone to help if the web instructions seem hard.The bonus is that this phone integrates wifi or 4g-data calling via Google seamlessly, so that you use your phone in the slick way Motorola has arranged it - just one extra tap as you make a call, to choose Google or your cell provider.The Marshmallow level of Android is very well developed and smooth with Motorola\\'s no-interference way of providing it -- plus the Google services you can add offer quite a lot, even including what seem to offer just as much by now as Siri. You can voice-type effectively, and there is swipe typing, a big advance on fingers or thumbs, if those are well provided for also. You can ask for Google lookups in a moment, then return to the note you were writing or the call you are on. You can ask to make appointments. where to find a laundromat or a meal, and so forth., and it all actually works.I\\'d have to say that as an actual old hand on what goes into these things, I feel a real sense of using something already travelling into a future.The ads -- actually, the Amazon ads are so far almost always tasteful, I know because I made an effort to look. If you have notifications, you are only going to see those ads as the same small notes,, very unobtrusive. I find the cacophony of other ads all through using some apps to be the real issue, and those have nothing to do with Amazon. The answer to them is to choose your apps from those which are tasteful about this, and that is something you can easily do.Your choice, then. If you\\'re not intent on spinning around with Pokemon, or playing reflex-demanding games, you might also find this quite a valuable bargain. I would suggest trying one out in a store, to see about the size, and then you can also learn about the smoothness. Style too, as this is always personal. This worked well for what I needed it for. Can\\'t beat the price. Used it in Cuba and it worked just fine. Very long battery life. Giving it 3 stars because to access the battery is next to impossible. Took several tries with a knife to pry the back off. It is not very user friendly in that respect. I love the phone!!! It\\'s light and a great size.👍 I got it in two days. Saved my 300 dollar tablet from water.This otter box case is my hero and i will never use any over band again the article did not come with headphones, also wrong packed with other items to buy and mistreated I am clumsy, this works great! Have a lot of problems, can\\'t hear phone calls have to use loud speaker. It works fine. Bit of a hassle to get all the messaging and data function up and running. I still haven\\'t gotten the MMS picture messages to send though.Edit:The phone works great now, just had to add a new apn to run on my carrier\\'s data plan. The sound quality with the headphone jack is a bit poor, too much background static when nothing is playing. Wish that it had more than 1gb of internal memory because it doesn\\'t always pick up that I have 16gb memory card in it. Good The phone works very well, especially for the price. Is not working eny more There is a problem with my Samsung Galaxy S6 Edge. it says factory unlock international version except most of the time it disconnects automatically from the network even when there is a coverage. Please advise. Excellent I love my phone this is my second droid 3 my first one worked better the new one freezes and doesnt let me type when the battery is low i loved my first one but this one is not dependable Does everything I want it to do and more 👍 Very good phone for the price, but the battery charge did not last for the period mentioned in the tech specs. Expected universal plug compatible with my other phone, NO. I can not hear the other person on the phone. I turned up all of the volumes I could find, NO HELP. I can\\'t use the phone. I expected it to be just like my other phone and I spent more because this one was brand new, not used. I had to get a different phone. great buy and fit my dad perfectly.. nice material and length! Went back and bought another in a different color! Camera is not clear but besides everything is good Great Real iphone 5s. Came in factory box sealed up like an apple store would sell it to you. It has some better features than the 4 and is ALOT faster! I like it! I sanded down my old sim card for my 4 and it fit in my 5 (save $10-20 on a sim card at tmobile) nice love my phone. Phone is exactly the same as written in the information page of the product. It is factory unlocked, and a NON Tmobile phone.Thanks for shipment. (Sold by: FGS Trading) It came in perfect condition as if it were new. There are chips around the edges but I was expecting that. Love the fact that it came with new headphones because I had lost my previous ones. The only thing is that the charger is not a good cord. If it is not plugged in the wall, it does not charge well. I tried to sync my phone through iTunes on my computer and it kept telling me it cannot read or sync due to some error. I have to use my Ipad charger but other wise. Its good. Great phone and good price.works great and fast,though the seller said the phone was used,the phone came sealed like brand new with all the accessories,thanks to surge telecoms Absolutely fantastic device for the money. Using it with AT&T Go Phone account and never been happier. Long day battery life, clean android interface, no weird bloatware uselessness. I chose this one for it\\'s small size because I have to text frequently while walking and this fits nicely in hands and with Swype you can text solidly with your thumb keeping you other hand free. Bought for deployment, protected my tablet great so far. All ports are easily accessible with case on. I\\'m also quite fond of the \"stand\" feature. Great purchase. International version. Did not work correctly. Excelent item! This phone outperformed all my expectations of it. Though it was supposed to be my temporary phone till I buy a one plus 2 or nexus, but because of this I have put my plans to upgrade on hold.Does all it is needed out of a smartphone. And the best part is battery. It just does not die.If you want to play high performance games, this phone is not for you. If you are like me, interested in productivity, connecting with people, using social apps -- this phone will suit you. Great watch for the price. If you are looking for more bells and whistles invest more money but for a test run with the smart watch market, this watch is great. It was shipped out in a few days and no hassle. The only thing I will suggest is to look at a few youtube videos on how to download the the BT notfification software. I would suggest using the barcode scanner to download the software. Work very good, Very good very well this cellphone scren is locked ,needed to enter pin , I don‘t know why ,anyonecan gime a advice? I have had this phone for only 2 months and when someone calls it reboots and the hot spot no longer works. I would think it would last longer than 2 months and when trying to return Amazon stated my 30 days were up. Really, 30 day warranty. Bought BLU products before and had better luck. Not happy Everything about this phone is perfect and works just as well as you would expect a flagship phone to work. Absolutely no complaints about the phone. I\\'ve had the Blu Win HD before and I really liked it but it broke and I got a lumia, and then that lumia broke and I got this Win HD. It looks pretty awesome and it\\'s performance is pretty good as well, I only have a few complaints. One is that when typing sometimes the phone does not recognize my touch. This can be kinda annoying at times, but for the most part it\\'s pretty responsive. Another is the speaker, not very loud, which I don\\'t mind, but it also has a tendency to rattle and crack with some music. I bought this for $75 and it was lowered to 60 the next day (I was super bummed) but for 60 bucks, this is a great deal, especially if you love windows phone like I do. Excellent!! IPhone have some problems which wasn\\'t mention in the description A decent little phone. Basic Android setup but sharp. I need help Works well to keep the phone from being damaged by dropping. Excellent! Amazing Phones, good working good my phone\\'s audio is gone after 3months excellent product and fast delivery If you are looking for a basic phone for international use, this phone works perfectly in the suburban and rural areas of Jamaica. Just charge and buy a sim card (Digicel or Lime) in Jamaica to add cell phone minutes. It felt nice and safe to have a phone to use soon as I entered the country. I was able to listen to the local Jamaican radio stations using this phone. Will purchase again for more international travel. perfect that was a real one I love my Apple Watch! I couldn\\'t tell it wasn\\'t brand new. It looks and works great and I got it at a fraction of what it would\\'ve cost brand new. Charger port did not work. Pink shadow on screen. Had to returned it. Glad I got my money back. Lots of problems with charging phone. .. It\\'s a great device, works excellent here in Venezuela REALLY BAD SERVICE!!!!! THE PHONE THAT I HAVE PURCHASED HAS BEEN MODIFIED IN FACT IF I DIGIT THE IMEI , I COULD FIND OUT THAT THE PHONE WAS SET WITH TIM MOBILE IN USASO THAT I CAN NOT DOWNLOAD UPDATES SINCE THE SOFTWARE HAS BEEN MODIFIED. THE SPEAKERS DOES NOT WORK AND I CAN REPAIR SINCE IN HTC EUROPE DOES NOT HAVE THE SAME SPAIR PARTS A IN USA. I WASTE MY ONEY AND I ISH TO HAVE IT BACK Great Fone. I like it a lot so far. The quality of images and video is perfect. The only inconvenience is the weight. It\\'s really heavy, especially for someone like me who when from Aaron Samsung mini straight to more bulky one. Works just fine! I thought it was Brand New......Thats how good it looks.... I wish there was more storage, but what I can say is that I really like this phone. Pictures are great! I have had it now for about 4 months and am very satisfied. It is just like the Galaxy everybody is going crazy over, I think the 5s or something. Whatever it is my sister has it, only I paid alot less for mine! Love it I have only had this phone for less than two months and it is already malfunctining on me. The messaging is wigging out!!! It has not been dropped, covered in a case, and not dropped in any water. There is no reason for the phone to freak out this way. I am unsatified with this and unpleased with the fact that the seller did not leave any contact information so that product may be exchanged. I am highly disappointed. 350.00 for a phone that is already screwing up!!! Good replacements still working just fine. I love it, it is new and exactly as shown and described. Thanks. very satisfied with thisproduct Was misled told the device was knocked it was not. This is a nice little phone. There aren\\'t really many bells and whistles but for $100 it\\'s worth every dollar. One thing I found extremely useful personally is that while the calendar isn\\'t anything to write home about, it will sync up with Microsoft Outlook. Lots of nice features but touch response slow. Nice looking phone. I only use the phone for one week and I will write review again. Sound volume poor. Clip broke with in hours of use. Could only get 2G or \"Edge\" on ATT network. Tried every APN setting possible. Otherwise its good for a cheap phone, just don\\'t bother if you are data heavy.Nothing worked better. Suggest picking up Amazon\\'s Moto Play for nearly same price. Albeit the Moto pushes advertisements. I love how well this phone holds on to a signal whenever I am in a call. Once I get connected to a call, I seem to be locked onto it. So far, zero dropped calls. Call clarity is better than my old iPhone 6s. Texting, using the phone\\'s messaging app, is simple but functional though a tad boring. Battery life is very good and can last the whole day from 100% charge at 7AM with heavy wifi and data use, streaming videos, phone calls (2-3 hours total) and heavy texting and Ill still have around 55%-63% battery by 9PM. Camera is just ok and nothing special though the manual mode is fun to use! The ASUS ZenUi is actually pretty interesting and the so-called \"bloatware\" can easily be disabled or uninstalled. What I am nervous about is the glass on the back of the phone which is cool to look at but in my opinion, an unnecessary embellishment. Overall a solid phone if you\\'re after speed, stability, and signal. It was next to impossible to link it with my phone with that bar code No !!!! It did not work with metro pcs ..i couldn\\'t go on the internet It doesn\\'t look like how it is Phone suit my needs and it works. this is a great phone no complain about except for the battery it runs out very quick but beside that is great.also i think its beautiful specialy the white oneyou wouldn\\'t regret it stronger then advertised. amazing case. excelente IMPORTANT: This device is NOT compatible with 3G on AT&T nor T-Mobile in United States. The spec of the R800\"i\" version only support the HSDPA 900 / 2100 bands, which neither AT&T nor T-Mobile in the US support. You will only get 2G speed. The R800\"at\" AT&T version use the 850 / 1900 / 2100 bands. The great thing about this is T-Mobile is beginning to enable support for 1900/2100 in various area, so if you manged to get an unlocked version of the R800at you can get 3G on T-Mobile if you happen to live in one of those 1900Mhz supported location.I have owned devices like the Galaxy S3 and Galaxy Nexus, I sold them and goes back to the Xperia Play because for someone who love classic console gaming there is no better choice as a phone. Bluetooth gamepads just doesn\\'t do it for me because they\\'re not really portable and can take time to setup.GREAT THINGS ABOUT THIS DEVICE:-THE GAMEPAD: I won\\'t have to explain this.-DURABILITY: It\\'s quite durable and can easily withstand \\'reasonable drops\\'. I have less concern about accidentally dropping this device than dropping highend devices with Gorilla Glass.-SOUND QUALITY: Audiophiles might realize that there are not a lot of Android phones with great sound quality. The headphone output quality is very good and to my ears comparable to the original Galaxy S which is another Android device with great sound.-aGPS and GLONASS support: This allow it to get reasonably fast location fix and stay fixed. Its not the most accurate, but for a being an older device its very acceptable and probably better than many other devices that only have aGPS.-CAMERA: For being a 5MP camera with LED flash it can take decent photos. It\\'s about 90% as detailed as the Galaxy Nexus 5MP camera, but is better with low light situation. It can record videos at 720p with continuous autofocus. However, there is a big flaw with the camera microphone\\'s volume being extremely quiet.The CONS:-Performance: Even at the time of release, this device have a hopelessly underpowered CPU and GPU combination and only ~400mb of usable RAM. It might not play some newer graphic intensive 3D games, however it does support many games. \"Classic gaming\" is where its at for this device.-Low brightness: The LCD display have accurate color, but is not very bright so can be hard to see under sunlight.-Will eventually get dirt underneath the screen because it\\'s not properly sealed, unless you\\'re a very clean and careful person.-Camera\\'s microphone: As mentioned, the camera microphone\\'s volume is extremely low, so recorded videos will be very quiet.-Small gamepad: Not a real con, but the gamepad of this device is a bit small so people with large hands might get cramps. I found the \"touchpad joysticks\" difficult to use.OVERALL: Even if you don\\'t intend to use this as a phone, it makes a very good portable music and gaming device, especially if you are a fan of classic consoles. It take decent photos and have good GPS signal.Note: I killed this device by installing a \"wet-applied screen protector\", which caused the phone to short out, the digitizer stopped working and other components messing up. So I recommend to be careful with water/moisture and don\\'t use wet screen protectors with this.Also read my comment on this review for more tips. It cant keep a charge I don\\'t have much to say about this product thats already been said over and over all reviews that its a very elegant and very modern and very much a phone that all phone users should have and experience..........very nice and I DO mean it Phone don\\'t work on CDMA network so plz don\\'t buy it super long battery life, clean live sound from speakers, easy to use display and on-screen keyboard. Letter recognition works. Cons: no real keyboard. Muy bien Best phone I have every owned. According with the seller description ok For all you people out there that buy phones that say they are \"unlocked\" and will work on any network, DO NOT believe it! This phone said it was capable with any network, but then I finally get it (9 days late) and take it to the Verizon store, only to find out that I have completely wasted my time and my money! It only works with AT&T, and T-Mobile, both of which suck for many reasons! Everything looks great for this phone. Incoming call quality and loud speaker is too low even after I set the call volume to maximum and phone getting warm while speaking.ASUS should take this seriously to improve the Call volume and speaker for incoming. This is the basic and most usage feature of Phone. The phone is good i think it is very good cell phone.... i can use it for every thing…. it is a complet phone…. This product is not an unlocked cell phone. I tried 3 different carriers and none of them could be recognized by this cell phone. I finally had to go back to my old phone and service. To make matters worse they are refusing to refund my money. Excelente This phone overheats very rapidly when you have a case on it. I had to take the case off in order to use it. Also, I have had to remove the SIMM card several times to reset the phone. I contacted my carrier and it is not a carrier issue. I think it is do to the over-heating issue. Excellent. The phone works well. Item as described. Works well as unlocked phone. Just inserted sim card and transferred numbers and it was ready for use. Received a used phone with over seven hundred hours of talk time on it. Was suppose to receive a new phone, not a used one. This worked flawlessly to replace my my son\\'s broken cell phone. We just switched the sim card and it was that simple. The camera quality is great which is an asset for me when purchasing a new phone. User interface is excellent and the phone very elegantly designed. It comes with a screen protector already on plus an extra. There\\'s also a pair of earphones included in the box which gives good sound quality.Pros: great camera 8mp, easy to use and understand, lots of cool features eg. Guest modeCons: sound quality is great but too low. The phone is not very loud when ringing or playing music. I would give it 5 stars if the phone was louder This phone was ok at first but it keeps freezing and restarting. I\\'ve only had it for about 3 days now. Haven\\'t downloaded anything or added any service yet. Its just factory mess up\\'s causing it to have issues I guess. Still not happy about this though. Have issues with calls dropping and screen freezing along with staying in 4g lite. I have my Samsung note for work so I know that it is available. It destroyed my 64gig sd card where I had my pictures and music saved. I bought 2 of these phones with the assumption that I would have lollipop by now. By the time that happens it will probably more version after marshmallow. Called customer service and the are clueless on if/when it will upgrade. Come to think of it my sd card bit craps that next day(something to ponder). Received a shotty battery with device. Amazon was perfect. The phone however has very poor performance I loved this phone when I first received but as days went by it was just to hot for me to keep holding this device to my ear. After a while the phone started shutting off during my calls the battery life sucks and it just wasn\\'t right for me overall beautiful pics it takes. As described. Works great. Awesome unique UI. Good condition and clean ESN. You don\\'t need to blow money on an M8 yet either. HTC upgraded the Sense UI and you still can use Google Now. Battery life not great, so I bought a second battery from the get go. Works great! Never had any issues so far. I don\\'t like it .it is not functioning right Great Phone at a great price good good quality... screen resolution isnt the best but is def in all ways better than the iphone This phone is really cool. The back cover was easy to take off. It charged in about 6 hours. I put a MetroPcs sim in the bottom metal tray and somehow it managed to stick in there and is impossible to get out. Then I went to Tmobile and got the 25 dollar talk/text plan. I put that sim card in the top tray. Then when I went to make calls it would ask me if I wanted to call from Sim 1 or Sim 2. To avoid having to make the choice every time I was able to go into settings and deactivate Sim 1. I loaded some mp3 music on there and it sounds great on my afternoon run. It only took a 16 gig card. 32 gig wouldn\\'t accept. Call quality through the headset is ok. My boss called me and it sounded like she fell down a well. It kinda diffused the \"importance\" of the call and made her sound kind of comical. The fm radio is killer and I have been listening to classical for a couple hours with no drop on the battery. There is a small learning curve on navigating the phones menus. I am happy with the phone and so far it is 17 bucks well spent. Nice dumbphone for those who are looking to take a break from a smartphonePros Battery Life, mp3 player, FM radio, car game, ok camera, nice screen, snazzy look(retro), cheap, headphone jack works greatCons working through the menus can be tedious but once you get the hang of it its easy, dubious call quality husband loves it ... When I received this in the mail after ordering, I couldn\\'t have been happier. The color was vibrant, the case fit snug and secure, and it bore the Lifeproof logo so I was content. Until 2 weeks later. The cover that covers the charger port is EXTREMELY snug and after 2 weeks of opening and closing it to charge it every night, it gave and broke off. I\\'ve gone through two cases and they have both done the same thing. I didn\\'t want to keep having to replace my case every 2 weeks so I ordered something else and returned it for a refund. I am way too busy to be waiting on phone cases. Other than that, the case seems great tho. After researching phones, I decided that this would be a good first phone for my young son. It was easy to set up and he is enjoying many of the features. Fantastic phone. I am loving it. It has amazing battery life! 👌 The phone looks and functions fine with US phone carriers. The box the phone came in looked old and opened but the phone looked new but was the Southeast Asian model. The charging adapters are made for Southeast Asia. Cool So I received my new phone about 2 days and a half ago and honestly its just what I was looking for I don\\'t know why some people even complain about it for the price you pay you have nothing to complain about seriously although I had a little complication with the Sim card cause it didn\\'t register my previous one I was using for straight talk so I had to buy a new sim and activated it through the phone it was easy although the internet didn\\'t want to work but I didn\\'t give up on it I ended up just calling my phone provider again and they fixed the problem so far its really fast much faster than my previous phone I was a galaxy user just gave it to my mom and the camera IS NICE good quality for what you pay for I\\'m happy with my purchase no regretsPS I never give reviews on anything but thought this should help cause I was really iffy about it at first as well So far so good with the fall Bought for my 88 year old mother. All others had failed, but finally found one she can use. The emergency button is cheaper than Life Alert so that is a big plus. She loves it and a relief for me that she has a phone with her that she can see and use. Highly recommend for the elderly. Peace of mind for sure. The system was supposed to be new but looked as if it had been refurbished. I just pulled the battery and put it in the old system. The battery is working about as good as the one I pulled from my old one. This is me is kind of suspicious. great phone fast deivery I dnt have a problem I actually love it BUT THEY LIE ABOUT THE WARRANT AND THAT WAS THE MAIN REASON TO GET THIS PHONE BECAUSE OF THE WARRANT The phone works very well. It is fast and responsive but the main problem is phone is taking very long time to charge but gets discharged very quickly even if you don\\'t use he phone which concerns me, thanks. 👍just connect the phone but a good show phone I have been used for 2 weeks so far so good but the interchangeable wall plug does not work! The battery is better than my Nexus 4 but the processor speed is slower than Nexus 4. The product arrived and was in the condition that I expected. The shopping experience was smooth and without difficulty. I looks like a big deal. It has good specs. However, it is the worst phone I ever had. I complete regret of have had this phone.First of al, it reboots by itself. I could have it in my pocket, for example, and it suddenly died/reboots without no reason. Another example could be when I accidentally dropped it, and/or it receives a LITTLE hit.Secondly, the bluetooth, 2G and 3G are pathetic. I always have problems with the connections. For instance, when I try to connect it to my car\\'s bluetooth, it is a pain in the neck(a problem that doesn\\'t happens with my friend\\'s phones in the same car).In conclusion, I won\\'t buy any THL product again. I\\'ll buy real enterprises\\' phones such as Sony, Apple, or Samsung because I\\'ve never had this issues with any of them. I hope that you found this useful. it\\'s Okay The phone is very good expect for its volume.its low I absolutely love my Blu Vivo 5. It is everything I need in a cell phone and more!!! Just what I needed. .it\\'s working perfectly fine. .great phone...I will definitely recommend it. Really great product. The camera quality is awesome. Works in Brazil. Really beautiful. This item had no iPhone in box box was resealed with some weird black tape only had ear buds and charger in box and box was in Japanese horrible fraud I\\'m currently overseas, and AT&T was giving me a hard time for unlocking my phone. I purchase this because I didnt want to carry two phones. It works great with my beat wireless headphones. Ita a little bulky however, it get the job done. If you are looking for something to wow you then this is not your product. It simple and reasonale to make calls. Works with sim card only. Sorry verizon users. Great phone. Very basic but excellent choice for a grandpa or grandma. It\\'s okay. The app is crap. I can\\'t figure out how to get the SMS to work. Calls work fine. I\\'m still trying to figure some of the features out. You just get what you pay for. i love this phone i put my cricket sim card in i love it only thing is you have to call the cricket so they can walk you thru setting up the APN on it so u can get your pic messaging or go into the store and have them do it for Perfect..!! My mom loved this and she is not tech savvy! I received this phone, use it for 1 week and the key is not working, particularly the return key just not working. I even reset the phone to factory reset, not working, no choice but return for refund. Haven\\'t used it yet but seemed to work fine but when you get it its in chinese and its real hard turning it american lol /its nice but the voice is very low and when i did figure the internet out i never used it cause all the pages turn chinese to so i really dont reccommend it it . I bought this product thinking that it was an original phonestarted having problems with the phone with connections and found out that the phone is a fake SamsungI bought it thinking that it was an authentic Samsung. Ordered my phone after looking at for a couple days,am very impressed by the quality of the phone, arrived on time and am loving it Didn\\'t expect to JUST a phone, nothing else. Phone had a scratch which wasn\\'t mentioned in description and I had to purchase charger and usb. Awesome smart phone. Runs lightning quick, surprisingly durable, looks decent and best of all TONS of memory and no pre-loaded garbage or restrictions. best phone ever very nice If they would have sent a charging cable with the phone they would have got stars. the phone was useless until we got a charging cord. I\\'m so surprise about this phone...great quality! In cheap price! happy happy the only cons is the long wait to be shipped.but its worth! Excelente compra todo en perfecto estado sin problemas recomendados 100 porciento ninguna queja buen trato bueno en todo sin novedad i love it I was forced into getting a smart phone because my carrier was retiring 2G services. I didn\\'t want to pay $700 for a new phone, so I found this one online. I love the look and feel. I\\'m still learning about all the features but so far I\\'ve been able to customize it to my liking. Samsung has a website that offers tutorials and videos. Very easy to follow. If you have a question, you can chat with a live person and get it resolved. Good!!! Ordered this phone for I wanted an android with old school virtual keyboard feel. It proves to be an expensive paperweight.. It\\'s hard to access the keyboard, ( could use some wd-40) and phone crashes after minimal use. I used it for two month before giving up on it.. Not recommended This crap does not have wifi ... hehe! That\\'s terrible for anyone these days. I\\'m not aware of that before buying, so I give it one star only because it is mandatory.Do not ever drive with! Works awesome with straightalk I still can\\'t use my I put my gsm card in and all I get is network not registered tried doing everything to get it to work and still cant Recomendado 100 % excelente producto, rapida entrega y embalaje, estoy muy contenta por haber realizado esta compra a AMAZON, los felicito por su atención, gracias this is a compact, easy to use phone that does what it is supposed to. The sound quality is good, & it is attractive. I love this phone the feel of it the weight and the size. Nice phone, but the camera has poor pic quality Everything was great and smooth until it got hard bricked.The screen is black (it\\'s shut down i guess) and it doesn\\'t respond to any button i press. Excellent product. It\\'s just user friendly, I hate electronics that are like algebra Great phone so far!Responsive with no visible lag, fingerprint reader is reliable (100% recognition so far!), and sound seems fairly clear. Camera starts up quick, but I haven\\'t really pushed the camera through its paces. The wife adores it, and plays Pokemon Go non-stop with no stuttering, lag, or overheating so far.Will update after more use! Wish I could leave 20 Stars! I was run over by a 5000 lb truck with my phone in my pocket inside this case! I now have a broken pelvis, tail bone, and left leg! My Galaxy S5 survived without a scratch! Above and Beyond our expectations! Thanks a million!!!! Very good Great. Really smooth OS, overall I\\'m happy with it. It\\'s definitely not the most powerful phone on the market right now but for the price point it is excellent. Great phone, long battery life. It is easy to brush the edge of the screen and cause some random swipes. Battery also heats up with heavy use. Camera is pretty good, but zooming it, you can see some fuzz. Bloatware is minimal, and can be disabled. Some nice Asus features added. There is a bluelight filter setting, one handed operation to shrink screen to one side, autostart manager, boost program to close background programs.It\\'s very fast iwth 3GB ram and 32GB (25GB effective) storage, supports microSD. Indeed has laser focusing, and can be used with an app to measure distances up to 50CM away. Comes with Android Lollipop 5.0.2. Make sure to look for a ZE550KL compatible case. Wont work with the Zenfone 2 ZE550ML case. Its a nice phone.Handy and Practical for messages.Good product compared to the price.It\\'s Easy to use and allows internet surfing. We bought this watch 2 months ago and it already works no longer... Very disappointed and my daughter too!!! The phone is a really awesome phone it works for every SIM, and for the price you can\\'t beat it. The sound is a little low when you talk on it but that\\'s the only problem I have had with it After a day my phone would not register that the battery was charged. I can\\'t stand not knowing if the device is 2hrs away from running out of power or 20hrs away from running out of power. The windows mobile features worked but the call volume was so low that even on speaker phone a person\\'s voice could not be heard in anything but a quiet room. The keyboard and large screen are great but overall this phone is to big not to get in your way.(its slightly bigger than a DS lite) This product being returned. The phone was a Christmas gift for my daughter and it said it was Sprint ready, which is my cell phone carrier. So, on Christmas day, I planned to have the phone activated so she could enjoy her gift. What I discovered was that the phone did not come with a SIM card. So, I had to go to a special, Sprint manufacturer store, get the card (which was free from Sprint), have it installed and activated at the store. If the advertisement said it didn\\'t come with a SIM card, I sure missed it! That was a pain in the butt and disappointing for my daughter on Christmas. Other than that, the phone works great and as always, Amazon did a great job getting the phone delivered. Thanks for the great service Amazon!! excelente This was the best buy for my situation, did not want to give my current phone carrier. They were able to activate this iphone with no problems. thank you. I am very pleased with my Galaxy note 3. This is my first smartphone and It\\'s awesome. My son has one that he paid a small fortune for. He was shocked that I found the G N 3 for such a good price. And it was delivered at the exact time Amazon said I would receive it. Was working great and setup on PagePlus was a snap. I went through the setup of my accounts and other personalizations when it asked me to update the software. Great! The device did its thing and was updated. A few hours later, another software update was needed, downloaded....and then the device goes into a black screen with tiny white lettering and an error message. Unable to recover from that. Attempted to do some research on online forums and it seems it is a consistent problems with that version of the software update for android on the droid 2. Was able to return with not much fuss. I think I\\'ll steer clear of the Droid 2 from now on. It is a very nice phone, and the very first phone from all the Chinese ones I\\'ve tried which connects to 4G LTE AT&T band in Boston. Reception is not bad either, I have marginal one at home and this phone keeps up with iPhone or Galaxy Note.It is a joy to hold, it has leather (I guess fake) back which fills very good in a hand. Camera is OK, a little trouble focusing but maybe I have not used to it yet.The reason for 3 stars is that it shut down/crashes several times a day. I\\'ve sent for replacement, I will update the review depending on how the second one behaves.Update: got the second one. Good news: did not crash during two days I\\'ve been using it. Bad news: camera is unusable. It was not that good in the first phone - it was hunting for focus, which was especially noticeable while filming videos. But in the new one it is totally bonked - it fills like focusing motor is rusty - it always slowly hunts for focus and frequently does not find it.So, if you do not care about camera and willing to take chances for $70 (I bought it on sale) you get a chance for a modern phone with good reception. Great phone! I ordered this phone for a present. The phone is just as described and works great! The phone does not have Spanish language installed, only English but it was easy to install from the RIM web site. Love the phone and got a great price for it. Good for anyone who\\'s looking for a nice cheap and useful smartphone for everyday use. Using for the tmobile line. works great Excellent Bad hasta ahora que el equipo esta acorde a mis expectativas; ha funcionado perfecto desde que lo recibí y he podido cargar sus paquetes sin ningún inconveniente aquí en Venezuela con la linea Movilnet! Nice watch charges in 20 min . headphones suck get the adapter . But I got it working with my chromecast as a remote :-D Gave this phone as a Christmas present to my daughter. Three days ago the keyboard on the lock screen disappeared. Have tried a soft reset and a factor reset with no success. It is exactly 30 days past the window to return it, so feeling a bit disappointed! I purchased this phone for my mom who doesn\\'t like touchscreen phones and she absolutely loves it!! Shipping was EXTRA fast and it was in perfect condition!! Great purchase:) I did a lot of research on this phone and thought I would take a chance. I am so glad I did, this phone is terrific, I couldn\\'t be happier..I have also got a lot of complements on it, I would and have recommended this phone to everyone. Great phone! Down side is a phone with 8gb is obsolete. Learned this the hard way. I\\'m an android guy but daughter likes apple along with the rest of the brainwashed kids. Spend the money for more memory if iphone is a must. It was nearly impossible to open the battery compartment. The plastic cover broke in the process. I charged it and installed a sim card, yet the phone didn\\'t work. After several efforts, I got frustrated and simply abandoned it. this product is not dual sim do not buy it has a dummy space that is cover but does not work Nice phone Is not compatible with anything. Had to return. It works well and the battery last a long time. It is uncomfortable to talk on for very long it\\'s a $20.00 phone I love Amazon but I bought 2 it said it was Sprint compatible after a month. I tried everthing. I feel like i am going to have a stroke Also now i cannot return or exchange them . A total disgrace The greatness of this Otterbox was no surprise to me. Its cheap insurance for your phone. I know its saved my several times. I like it :-) It satisfies all my expectations and it has lot of useful features that make me love this phone. It only has minimum errors that occur almost never. Like the phone but Sprint said it would not exept their sem cards and was not a sprint compatable phone. As the seller boasted it was. Didn\\'t perform well!! It\\'s the wrong one,it\\'s too big. - Works with Straight Talk.- LTE, 4G, 3G, etc all work just fine.- Ships with windows 8.0- Can be updated to 8.1 for free.- Cortana personal assistant is part of 8.1I use the Straight Talk AT&T sim card, and it works great. There seems to be confusion reg Excellent Works great.. highly recommend I really really reaalllly wanted to love this phone. I am a phone geek... I love smartphones since I buy them, test them and sell them back eventually (if I so desire). Thorough research was done before I purchased this particular model since I have recently decided to delve into the budget phone market and choose BLU as the guinea pig. After purchasing the BLU Studio Energy & the BLU Win HD (two amazing phones), I decided to try the BLU Studio 6.0 Lte. Why? Because I love big screen phones and wanted a cheaper T-Mobile Lte alternative (this phone has all the bands to support T-Mobile).Let me start with what I love about this phone... the screen is GORGEOUS... amazingly crisp and bright. Some would say the phone is laggy... but it was surprisingly zippy considering the specs are low. The camera seem to take decent photos also... all this I tested in less than a week.Now for the bad... Android 4.4.3... not a bad version but just bad on this phone. I can\\'t even get a percentage meter in the notification bar for my battery. OK... so I decided not to nitpick with that one and went on to test other things... like a new clock widget. I tried the HTC Sense clock from the Google Play store and it doesn\\'t work.... that was strike 2. The I decided to try my Moto 360 Smartwatch with this phone... it paired ok but the Motorola Connect app just would not work. Thought it was a BLU thing so I tried the Moto 360 on the BLU Studio Energy... it worked perfectly (I suspect it may be the android version since the Energy has 4.4.4. while the Studio Lte had 4.4.3). Throughout all this testing, I realized the Google Play Services keep crashing which rendered the phone unusable.I had to restart several times to get it to stop but the last straw was ... my T-mobile connection kept fluctuating and whenever it does work, I only get Edge speeds. Tried the sim in my Blu Studio Energy and got 4G.I was hoping I could love this phone... but with the inconsistent connectivity, buggy software and incompatibility (somewhat) with my Moto 360.... I will have to return this product. Good afternoon , this cell I arrived damaged me , no lights Phone started out great, I loved it. And I still do, when it works. Past couple days it has been restarting itself out of nowhere and when I try to turn it back on, it wont even come all the way on. It flashes the AT&T logo then turns off again. Really frustrating when I\\'m in the middle of something. this item arrived perfectly fine, on time and it looked great on the outside but the part where it charges the phone was old, moldy and burnt, and there is no way to fix it. I wasted $250. It\\'s a good phone,but the camera it\\'s all of that This phone is a very nice size. Easy to start up just insert the SIM card and turn on. My problem is the phone is very slow. I bought this for my husband he likes it. It is a good phone for a beginner. I also bought a phone for myself and returned it after several weeks. I could not handle the slow processing speed. When I returned the phone the seller credited my account as soon as UPS scanned the package in. Excellent customer service. Cute but difficult to use. It came without instructions. Most standard phones in this country use the same functionality, not this one. Once you figure it out it works well. Great hardware. The build quality of the Nokia is unparalleled. Having said that, I have to admit that the phone fails completely when it comes to software. I\\'m returning my phone since basic capabilities are turning into nightmares. Hopefully microsoft should come up with a solution to this excellent piece of hardware. WISH THAT IT WOULD TAKE A 64 GB SD CARD I love this phone. I don\\'t have anything negative to say. perfect and fast shipping I always liked Sony Ericsson cellphones, but I am amazed by this one. The display is beautiful, the sound is great, it\\'s fast, and I\\'ve been using it for a month now and haven\\'t had any problem.I would definitely recommend this cellphone! So much faster than my iPhone 4s.Everything came in the box... iPhone, charging cable and plug, Verizon sim card, earplugs. I took it to Verizon to switch over to my new iPhone 5s but the rep in the store told me that I could have done the setup at home. :) i lke this product muy buen producto, excelente vendedor, entrega rapida y efectiva, me llego en excelente condiciones, agradecido por tan buen servicio prestado Purchased this as a temporary phone for my husband after his other cell phone broke. He really likes this phone and we can\\'t believe the quality for the price. He has only been using it a few days, but he has been able to download his favorite apps, watch videos, and take good pictures. It arrived already charged and included all the accessories one would need to get started. The headphones, case, and screen protector were a great added addition! first phone was new but didn\\'t work propery. replace with used phone works great. secon phone apeared new just not in box. needed to get a new SIM card from AT&T but so much better than the S3 I purchased this for my trip to visit my family in the United States. This phone worked great with a great battery life. It was a tad bit on the slow side sometimes when navigating different applications. But for the price, I was not faltered by it at all. I used a \"Straight Talk\" sim card and it worked flawlessly with quick 4 G speeds. No complaints. After to put the phone in a water test, my phone was damaged because the water entered inside anyway.... now the phone is totally death and is just a plastic piece of 500 USD. Sony told me that I can not claim the waranty, I feel completly cheated with this phone by Sony, I never ever will buy a Sony phone anymore. Great product. My aunt loves it. Great for older folks. I had the plan phone from ATT and loved it, but out of no where the phone refused to take a charge. I then purchased the unlocked version and found nothing but trouble. The charger that came with it did not work, the main language was in Korean out of the box, the system was out of date for a month despite updating every hour for a month on its own, and the icing on the cake was the screen shattering after falling no more than twelve inches to the ground.I wish the first one I purchased would have just kept working, but that\\'s life. Now I\\'ll try my hands at an entirely different Windows phone.Oh, and the only charger that will work with this is phone is a single one...the chargers that have a separate plug and cord do NOT work. Much better quality than the 720p version but had a real hard time getting it onto WiFi. Had to direct connection then teach it the network. I thought the screen was bigger on the classic Brought this for my son for Christmas, he hasn\\'t complained once. So I guess its a great smart phone, all the features of my Galaxy Note, he is watching Netflix and everything with no problem. Great inexpensive phone with all the functionality of an expensive phone. Excellent 4th generation Galaxy. This phone is a piece of crap. Yes its a older unlocked refurbished phone but it should at least do what it says it can. Not happy at all with it. Enable I hadn\\'t bought it. Pretty much perfect, the only problem is the front camera quality isn\\'t that great. I love this phone!!!\"! Iphone 6S Pus that bought from Amazon is awesome and as per expectation. very nice Perfect. Just as described. Works on Tracfone on Verizon network. The phone was in good working condition and new. However, the entire manual was in spanish (which I do not know a word of). So I\\'ve had to ask friends who have the same phone for instructions or help in finding certain things in the phone. The phone was even in spanish, I had to select a bunch of options until I saw English...this sucks. Works great looks brand new no issues would highly recommend this company to anyone I know I fell in love with this phone. I\\'m not a big phone person and don\\'t really care of having the latest technology or all that extra junk. Just needed a phone that was simple,more updated then my last phone, good picture quality and could run fast as I do go on the internet a lot and use my email for a lot of important things. This phone tops it all its super fast and I never knew how great an unlocked phone could be because my tmoblie service works great! Came in great condition and delivery was great and fast. Best decision I ever made with buying the perfect phone made for me! I love it so much thank you amazon and open group wireless! Excellent job :) It is perfect... This iphone was in very good shape....works fine...and unlocked...gracias... works great Was not in the system and could not be activated Very few directions came with it and they were very poorly translated from Chinese to English. I was forced to return it. Too bad, it seemed like a nice little phone. Absolutely love this phone. I\\'ve had no problems since purchasing it, more than 6 months ago. It really is a beautifully made phone. I bought the gold version and still love it. The speed of this phone is unmatched to the numerous other androids I have had. Highly recommend. damaged and would stick. could not use but I returned it thanks I had no battery samsung but a nokia and comes without headphones. I am very disappointed. Would not recommend. No guarantee because they do not provide good service. I bought it for Christmas and so far I have no complaints I love it BNIB Quick delivery - highly recommend. It came with scratches and dents on three of its edges.and the worst part is the so-called refurbished phone did 382 battery cycles!The seller is called \"MyWit\" Nice phone but doesn\\'t work with Virgin mobile or cricket only certain carriers so be careful when purchasing This is an excellent phone considering the price and the fact that I got mine as a refurbished piece. Quick, responsive, and can be used with straight talk or net10. excelente servicioexcelente producto con todas mis expectativas no puedo pedir mas y el servicio demaciado bueno gracias muchas gracias cool I bought this phone in 2012 nd it got stolen that same year. But I loved it. I got a iphone now After one month, a chip on the logic board failed which controlled recharging the battery. Not Repairable. Had to purchase a new phone. I could have exchanged the phone with Apple for Ver5, but chose to upgrade to 6S and get a new phone. Stunning CAMERA! Best phone out there, battery lasts 40 percent more than z5 faster, better. The only downside, is that no small apps again. The fingerprint sensor works only with UK firmware.Doesn\\'t bring any headphones the reception is fantastic. Great as described this phone is tough it can take an abuse Everything I expected I\\'m impressed. It is a great phone to have. Thin and light and full of wonderful features. Tech support is a little slow in responding to my question but the it does not detract from the phone itself. Now if BLU can update it to the latest Android operating system, I\\'ll give it 6 stars. Good phone but overheating The battery is too short the net work don\\'t on it without wfi I\\'m not enjoying it I think I want to send it back I like it unfortunately the herd mentality tends to support Apple\\'s product thus there are fewer applications for this great, and in my opinion superior, smartphone. Totally love this phone. It\\'s a little bigger than I wanted to have to carry but on the other hand I like the big screen. Serious bang for the buck. So far I can\\'t find a thing I don\\'t like. one if best on market honestly better than iphone or galaxy pretty fast on straight talk works great for bring ur own phone deal. great services strong singnal where some phones wnt have service im honestly staying with the rarz line if ur an andriod person then this phones for you. Goog value for mony, great support from the seller I AM TIRED OF GETTINT THESE SURVEYS,,,, PLS GO AWAY Works good. updated review. Purchased this phone on November 27, 2015. Worked great for 5 months. It started to not keep track of time last week. Now it doesn\\'t charge. I DO NOT RECOMMEND this phone or BRAND. Stay away, far away!!!!! Works as expected. I returned this device because it was larger that I expected. So far so good. I would recommend Very happy at this price point. There are definitely better phones out there, but this one offers a lot of bang for your buck. It performs well and didn\\'t come with too much bloatware. I have been through two other phones with Net10 and this phone kept me with the service. The quality of the phone and the \"Verizon\" CDMA towers it uses in my area make it seem like I\\'m using contract phone service with Net10 prepay. Phone call quality is very clear and I have service in areas I didn\\'t have with my previous Verizon Wireless contract phone. After using this phone for less than 3 months. It\\'s plagued by a host of ills. Battery charge and charge indicator is epileptic (I\\'ve had the batteries go from 100% to 0% in a minute). Phone randomly goes off in at random battery levels even at 42% charge. And phone exhibits ghost screen effect randomly.I regret buying this product and it\\'s certainly not worth buying. The only reason it\\'s getting one star is because I cannot give zero star. Everything went great. Phone was in great shape and works perfectly. I Love My Phone Works Perfectly Not One Problem. Bought this phone on September 7 2015 and my screen was damaged I did not drop the phone or anything I turned it on and the screen looks dim from the bottom and lightly dimmmed on top and the screen looks blurry didn\\'t even last a whole two months. It has an awesome display, excellent battery life and a nice performance.Pros:-Excellent build quality.-Clear, bright, with nice blacks screen.-Awesome software performance.-With apps like Camera360 the camera really stands out.-Front flash works nice.-The fingerprint reader is REALLY fast.-Dual-Sim-Expandable Storage-Quick charging, well, quickly charge the phone.Cons:-Because of the Full HD screen, 3d gaming is not good, I mean games like Asphalt 8 will run at around 25fps in low settings. But its fine for a 200$ smartphone :DOverall I\\'m pleased with the phone and I highly recommend it.Overall I really like it and I highly recommend it- I wanted a cheap fitness tracker with clock.The Bad: The pedometer said unavailable, the sleep tracker said unavailable, and I could only find the sedentary alert once- don\\'t know if that worked.The Middle: The band on it is huge. I\\'m a big girl that usually uses extra links in a watch, and I was on the second to last hole here. It\\'s thicker and heavier than I expected, but I think I would get used to it.The Good: Even though I didn\\'t want to connect it to my phone, it connected easily to my iPhone 6. I could get my music, even though it wasn\\'t very loud. I liked the idea of an FM radio. Even though the headphones didn\\'t fit, good sound quality. When I received the package I was really excited. When Opening it up I got a $100 gift certificate for wine, xsmall iPhone charger and a mismatched wall plug. Regardless of all of that, I was so happy to see how well kept the iPhone 5c was. As I go to register/swap out the devices it was taking way longer than usual, and the sprint consultant told me it would still be a 42-72 hour wait, to hear back from the IT department. Apparently the phone wasn\\'t working with the Network or with my annual contract . I\\'ll wait and see what happens with their it guys, then if needed send it Back. Great seller. Very good item description including photos of actual phone being purchased. Kudos! Keep up the great work. Wonderful! Cool looking! Sort of Art Deco. Bought it for my mom for its elegance and eas of use. She\\'s a nanogenarian. The product itself is good however the companion app that runs with it is not up to par. The companion app continues to crash and keeps wanting to update after running updates the companion app then continues to crash more conductivity between the device and my smart phone is non-existent. The device in and of itself is very nice and functions very well however the device is practically useless to me without the necessary companion app. Excellent Love it! The speakers are so good I heard voices in the video and thought they were behind me it kinda scared me considering I was alone at my house. Great looking phone, almost new looking. It came wih a funky charger tho, maybe European?? Thankfully I had another regular American charger. Like it for the price. However, I could not get multiple clock faces and the gold finish is flacking after a few months. I have the previous vertion and I bought this one to have more capacity downloading social apps, but it clashes like the other telephone.in which I could only use whatsapp. Now I have whatsapp and Instagram and that\\'s it. It does not accept another one like Twitter or BB pin or Line. This product is not of the best quality. It didn\\'t last for a long time before it started going bonkers. I have since tossed it in the trash. I hope receive, Just once, tomorrow august 25 or Friday August 26, thanks. Phones were refurbished when they supposed to be new and was not able to received and send calls. Worst of all I had already send them oversee and could not returned them. This phone is amazing. It runs smoothly and takes stunning pictures with its 8.0 mega-pixel camera. The battery life isn\\'t great. Also, you have to use the headphones that come with it or it will (even on its lowest setting) destroy your eardrums. The basic design of the phone is nice and I love the screen\\'s clarity. If you are considering buying this phone, invest in a case for it as well. The screen is not fragile but since it\\'s so big it\\'s better to be safe than sorry. Over all I would definitely recommend this phone to persons of all ages. great product and value excelente Bought this for my husband. He does love it, however it drains his phone too much and too fast. Awesome phone my son love it he can get all his school work in it thanks I am an American consumer and was excited to replace my blackberry relatively cheaply. When I first received the package I was surprised that the box was entirely in Spanish and for Movistar (Spanish/Latin American carrier). The seal was broken, the phone was dirty, there was no memory card. Instructions were only in Spanish. Even the charger plug is European style, not American--i.e. you would need a *converter* to plug it in to an outlet here!! How ridiculous. The version from Excell should be advertised as a phone for European and Latin American consumers only, it is not appropriate for use in USA. Great phone for the money! The battery was defective. No question about it, this phone is amazing for the price. my only problem is the camera, but it can be experimented with to produce good shots. Battery life is great for a heavy user like me, and it works great with T-Mobile. The RAM surprisingly does make a small difference. I had 35 apps open and was switching between them rather fast, and it did not lag at all. Overall, the price cannot be beaten This smartphone I really like it. The features are awesome.Most of all the price was reasonable. Great phone no problems so far. Bought this phone to use on vacation and I tested it at home first to check battery life and overall condition of the phone. It has been perfect. The battery lasts a long time and the phone is reliable. I know I made the right choice to use as my local phone when I am in a different country. Great Phone For A Great Price !!! Love the features on this new system. Great to have an Iphone again. I dont think they are overated like everyone says. I think that Andriod id full of too many advertisments and seems kinda unsafe when downloading programs. Looks brand new and was better than described. Arrived early! This company was pleasing to work with. Loved the look and how the phone functioned the 2 min I got with it. Unfortuanetly we realized we bought a phone that didn\\'t work with the service provider. I recomend you call your service and make sure they will work 100%. Not all GSM phones will work with the service plans. I would buy this phone in the future as long as my service provider accepts them perfect! product as described, immediate shipping! This is an excellent phone, is truly awesome, but.... I bought this phone (International Version) from this seller FGS, brown and everything, the only problem I got, was that the international version results to be Indian Version, that means, it has only 1 language English (India), Android allowed me to install an application to change the language, however, some text still appears in English, I think it should be explicit in this publication.Beside that language problem, the phone is outstanding, I\\'m truly happy with its performance and capacity, the battery \"drain problem\" is fixed with Juice Defender application, therefor, I think is excellent and you should buy it with eyes closed.I rated with 4 stars because I kindda feel this is a \"tricky\" publication. Not too happy with what this phone has to offer. Performance is good. Variety not do good very good Very good phone Super Cool, Excellent for Texting, Not too big and Not too small, it\\'s just right!!! Item delivered on time as expected. Great deal. The Sprint phone is easy to use, quite sturdy, and offers 3G\\'s. I have bought before this one had a few small issues such as the \"P\" button not working when upright, but It is still worth the cost to me and beats the heck out of ATT. great so far Received the watch however so disappointed it doesn\\'t work.I don\\'t. Know if I want to return it for another....may get another bad watch.put the sim card in.nothing.message screen continues to flash and can not navigate.what a waste bueno I got my son and my self this modle different colors and we both love them. About to order my mom one. Its a great phone for the price!!! U wont be sorry.. Its been a month since we have been using them on STRAIGHT Talk unlimited plan...uses 4g fast!! Very nice case. good Good phone at a great value. Works perfect on T-Mo with new nano sim installed at store. ~$30 charge at T-Mo store for new sim installed and activated. Needs nano sim and type C charging cable. Charger comes with type C to type C ~1.5 ft/.5m cable that cannot be used for data connection on computer with standard type A USB plug. Plan on additional cable & charger purchase and check amperage rating on charger. Smart charger with amp detection or smart USB charge station recommended. good The description does not state the screen size for this version is 5.2 inches and will not fit in any of the 5.5 inch cases sold in the USA. DO not buy this. No way to find a 5.2 case in US. Dimension information is missing for most cases even if it states it fits your model phone. No way to call a vendor to get info before purchase of a case. Not good if you think you might drop your phone. Ever. It doesn\\'t play videos Got it on the next day! looks and feel brand new. Its good for the price and a starter watch. Worked great until the new lollipop update now cant get any notifications because the BT notification software will not work on lollipop. 7 months with this phone. I love everything about it. If there was one criticism I didn\\'t like about it was the music player. But Google Music makes that a negligible issue for me. I had an iPhone 5 got messed up, and needed a temporary replacement. Bought this one, never went back to the iPhone. I\\'ve dropped this over dozens of times (don\\'t even use a cover) and not a scratch. Love it Even doh the phone does not have a slot for memory card the performance of the phone is great. Excellent pic\\'s when using it and also excellent video at 720p great felling in the hand for use and fit properly I took delivery of this phone in Sept 2015. This product was advertised as a 4G phone but actually operates only on EDGE. Very disappointed with the product. Better than, what I thought I really can\\'t see the everyday benefits to using this phone over another. I\\'d recommend a BLU Studio 5, LG V 10 or other LG. I\\'ve used the 3, 4, and 5 from friends and my own order and I always have issues or parts issues.The phone I got was supposedly Gold, which I paid extra for but it looks reflective silver.The front camera had a red hue and I reset all settings with no change. Back camera has blue hue from time to time and will NOT focus, not good for micro/macro focus shots.The battery drained 25% in 30min with 1 3rd app installed and no background processes other than the ones I can\\'t turn off from Samsung running or tabs open.It overheated like crazy during charging, it was just sitting there with the cord that came with with it and I was worried I\\'d have to pull the battery out of the phone... But the back case didn\\'t come off. Huge drawback.I couldn\\'t tell if these issues were \"normal\" but it made my phone impossible to use. Side note, after I added my email to the phone my account was attempted hacked over 20 times in one day. Somehow since I constantly change my password and don\\'t give out my email... I don\\'t think it\\'s a coincidence... I feel it transmitted data for feedback but my email got sent to whet it was visible by others.Pros for this phone, it\\'s very thin, but weighs little so it\\'s easy to lose grip. Screen looks great. Can apply themes/skins that are cute. Has nfc technology. Phone is great works fine it\\'s brand new just wish it came with headphones but it\\'s all good I am very pleased with my purchase of the IPhone 5s Wife love her phone Exactly what was described! Great buy! I was dissapointed with the fact that the original box was opened when i got it ( i guess they updated the software ). Other then that, the phone works great. no problems with it so far. floating touching screen and the nfc technique are so cool! I love its appearance so much! But the only pity is that it cant be changed the bettery. Delivered in time and phone condition was as described. This watch met all of my expectations. I love ... it worked perfect in Venezuela . It was the perfect phone to replace my old 4s... I recommend it, thank you very much great The phone got so hot it melted!!!!!! This phone is amazing and i bought this phone without no problem and i am very happy for amazon.com and LG G3 . I am sugguesting everybody get this phone quickly you have feel better and better thank you amazon thank you lg :) I love my Sony Xperia z5 compact!! It\\'s comparable in size to the iPhone 5c just right for me and having an amazing sound and picture quality is a huge bonus!!!! This is a good to great phone. Its depends on your user level.I bought it because I was traveling abroad and needed a GSM phone that I could use in that country for people to call me locally and still have access to my regular phone. The reason I gave it a range is that for me, it seem a bit slow, given that I use a much faster phone on a regular basis.But this one served its purpose.I would recommend this phone for anyone travelling abroad and wants a local number. love this model - first one had a software problem, but seller accepted a return easily too,. I\\'ve been using the phone for two weeks, until now everithing is ok. The phone is easy to use, intuitive and fast.You can find lots of apps for everithing, and they work fine.The only things that i don\\'t like are the battery and the lack of an included micro sd card. I have to charge the phone twice a day if i use normally on internet and etc.. I hoped that for the price the phone include a micro sd but it doesn\\'t.So i recomend the phone, it will do almost everithing that you need. Don\\'t waste your money on expensive phones just for the brand. Phone received was stolen, T-mobile couldn\\'t activate it. I sent it back with a prepaid label provided by Bastex that did not even cover the cost of sending it back, I paid an extra 8$ to send back this stolen phone. I was ultimately refunded minus the extra 8$ to ship it. Also just received an email from Bastex asking me to remove this review..why would I do that it is a completely accurate account of what happened..too funny. This phone is amazing. On the other hand, this seller isn\\'t. After 8 months of proper use, my IMEI number dissapeared, when i dial *#06# the reply is \"null\". I have not rooted the phone. I can still use normal features, except i dont get signal, i\\'ve changed SIM cards, mine works in another phone, and others SIMs dont work in my phone. There is a red \\'x\\' above my signal bars. I sent a mail for help to the provider but no reply. I send a return request to the provider and amazon replied: \"Reason for the closure of your request: Expiration of returns period. Seller comments: <none>\"I mean, i\\'ve tried normal reset, hard reset and even downgrading firmware to stock, problem hasn\\'t been fixed, Not even a year has passed and I\\'m gonna have to change phone to some used one that a friend doesnt want no more. Amazing phone... straight out of the box at to work it went. Couldn\\'t ask for a better phone.. I like this phone because it is so easy to text on, since that\\'s all my kids and grandkids do to keep in touch. This is my second Pantech phone, it\\'s about as close to a smartphone you can get without being one with all the hassles they have. My only gripe is that the battery life isn\\'t very long if you talk on it very long. could not get phone activated on page plus came with wrong battery This phone did not work! 50% of calls were either dropped or wouldn\\'t go through. I can\\'t return because window has been closed. Apple won\\'t replace because I didn\\'t purchase from them. I\\'m out $300. I recommend you do not buy! Meets my expectations surely This is a great phone. I still feel the 640 is the best value, but with the 950 you get windows 10 from the starting gate, and dont have to fight through an upgrade process than can be quite cumbersome. Also, you get a better camera and hardware improvements. For me, I dont use the phone in such a way as to notice the HD camera or really test the limits of the hardware...The MAIN function that makes this phone better in my view is the Visual VoiceMail...I cannot stand having to listen to all the voicemails I have until I get to the one I want to hear.Both the 950 and 640 have numerous cheaply priced cases that work perfectly...One thing I do not miss about the iphone is the cost of an otterbox!As someone who is familiar with Android and IOS, and someone who has owned/used many iphones from the 3 to the 6plus, I can tell you that Windows 10 phones are much better than the nay-sayers are admitting...there are a lot of apps available for them as well.I will tell you that there are less stupid apps available...if you are a twelve year old girl like my daughter you may find less ways to waste your time in the MS Widnows App Store...but as for real apps that actually do something productive and useful, I am lacking nothing switching from Apple to Windows. Thank you about iPhone I love it !!! After just 3 days it was here, everything works excellent and I\\'m just in love with my new iPhone !! Great phone, other than the fact the memory doesn\\'t allow you to add additional memory, although there\\'s space on the phone I cant keep much apps. Excellent Just what I needed to replace phone that was dropped in water. Insurance wanted to give me a refurbished white for the same amount of money. nobody buy this phone it is the worst phone in the world and it turns off and wont turn back on. Great product.... Awesome phone delivered before time Item is good, a touchscreen. Words are so tiny, I\\'m having difficulty punching in numbers. Sometimes the stylus pen won\\'t, when typing in English, it becomes difficult 1. Because the words are tiny. 2. The wordings appears in other languages & trying to make it appear in English is very hectic. 3. Would prefer Bluetooth instead of the earpiece, it makes it dangerous to use in other countries. The watch should be able to bend. I bought this phone because I always wanted a razor and i really like flip phones. Not big on touch screens. And the Razr is just one of the coolest designed flip phones. I had to have it. The phone came on time and was well package. The reason I gave it a 2 was because of these reasons. The side buttons for volume and voice record are very loose. Almost feels like they are going to come off. The cover over the front screen on the outside was coming unglued. The battery cover had dents in it already. And the keys are also coming unglued. Gluing the cover and keys back is not a big issue. But this phone was supposed to be brand new. It was more in used condition. The biggest problem right now is the screen will go black and not come back on. I\\'ve only have used this phone for a total of 3 weeks. I have to take out the battery and restart it all over again. And the screen doesn\\'t always come back on. Takes a few tries. It was working good until this. If it didn\\'t have all these issues I would have gave it a 5 star rating. So if you want one of these phones be careful when you buy them. Your taking a risk. You may or may not get a new one. Fantastic phone for the price. Very good I love my new phone and it works real good. My only complaint is why does it have to be so big. By the time you add protectice screen and case thu phone is like a small tablet and quite heavy. The cell phone was in very good conditions. It works fine. I am impressed by the overall feel of this phone. It is well made and feels sturdy. The phone is fast and exciting to use. I had it up and on my carrier within minutes of inserting the sim card. I am very impressed. i have not recevied my blackberry now have i received any information on it! DISAPPOINTED. EXTREMELY. yet my money was taken of Great experience. As expected. excellent You know, I was very skeptical of getting a used iPhone on Amazon.I wasn\\'t sure about anything when buying this phone. It was sold by a seller named \\'K&K Realty\\' and had no other descriptors other than that the phone was in \"very good\" condition. I needed a phone pretty quickly, so I chose it based on the fact that it was PRIME eligible and the seller had ~90% positive rating. I took my chances.Well, the phone came in great condition. Hardly any scratches. The iPhone met the expectations of the sellers \"very good\" condition it was stated to be in. I hurried towards a corporate Verizon store (corporate stores won\\'t charge for SIM cards) and had them transfer my account info and number over to the iPhone. It took about 10 minutes.Overall, I am happy with my purchase, even though I was skeptical at first. I had no problems with anything. Bien This is the first smartphone that I have owned and so far I like it. Even though this is my first smartphone I still know how to use it because of owning a couple of tablets. This phone seems to run smoothly and starts up fast. I like that it has a finger print scanner that you can use it to lock your phone. As far as the specs for this phone goes it seems to be a good deal for it\\'s price. I also like some of the things that Moto did with this as far as the hand gestures that allow you to go straight to something without unlocking and searching for them. Such as making somewhat of a chopping action with it in hand will turn on the flash light, which is bright, and twisting your wrist quickly will open up the camera. The version of Android that this came with is very basic so you don\\'t need to be worried about there being a bunch of bloatware on it to slow it down or waste space. As far as cell phone networks go this is one of the few unlocked phones that I have seen that will work with just about any network provider. I use att which I read a couple of reviews where people had issues getting their LTE to work but I didn\\'t have an issue with this at all. I went to an att store to get my sim card though. The size of the phone isn\\'t that bad to me either it\\'s a little bit bigger that my flip phone was but not near as thick thankfully. The screen is bright even on a low setting so far I haven\\'t had a bright sunny day to see how well it works in direct sunlight. The camera\\'s take great pictures too. The sound is plenty loud enough but don\\'t expect a stereo effect from this phone since it only has the one speaker which is fine with me. Charging on this phone is extremely fast only takes about an hour and a half to charge to 100%. One thing I\\'ll need to keep my eye on though is that it seems to get a little warm while charging. Other than that this phones seems to work great.I mainly bought this phone because I was looking for a good budget phone and this one caught my eye along with a couple others but I ended up going with this one because of research and readying good reviews. I\\'ll update my review if anything happens that would cause me to change my opinion on this phone.My advice though if your looking for a good budget phone and one that leaves you with a good amount of options in cell service providers than this is the phone you\\'ve been looking for. 30 days after our 2-year Verizon contract was up, I threw my old Note 3 about 8-feet into the air and it landed on concrete. Bad day. Didn\\'t want to get into another 2-year contract and I loved the Note 3, so came looking for this unit.Looks and acts brand new! Moved the SIM and SD card from the old to the new and it started pulling my apps back down to the new device. It did take about 90 minutes to download and install all of the Android updates. Honestly, for all I know this device was never owned by anyone and was liquidated from some cell phone retailer who went out of business.Packaging was good, but not retail. The charger and cable are not USB 3.0 items that would come with a new Note 3, but they are serviceable. I still have what came with my original Note 3.There aren\\'t any features on the Note 4 or Note 5 that made me want to invest in them and I like that all of my old accessories (extended battery, sound dock, spare pens) are still useful to me.No regrets! This is a great phone. I did not want an iPhone 6, so I chose the 5S. My only complaintis (and the only reason why I did not give it 5 stars) is that the battery is short lived. To methat is annoying especially when I have not used it that much and the battery is down to75 or 80%. So I have to charge it frequently. If anyone has a hint for me to increasebattery life, I\\'d love to hear it. Its a junk.im trying to dial and it keeps on typing numbers cant stop it. When sim card was placed in the phone it fried every sim card that was placed in the phone Works with ringplus, get sprint sim simglw236c from best buy for $5.Built in texting app won\\'t send mms texts on ringplus. Workaround is to use 3rd party text app like textra sms, then mms texts work fine. I was hoping it would work with my iPad. It will not. This team will not buy it for my nephew, is no international version, is AT & T, normal rest. I have not used but my nephew is doing very well with it. Also I think the team is not completely new. By entering the battery cover will damage one of the fasteners, and with the backing to buy him and he realizes that. It has a small manufacturing defect where you enter the SIM, has a protruding plastic to be lifted in order to enter it. Great seller.fast Shipping don\\'t buy this item. To my fellow T mobile and Huawei Mate 7 users - I come bearing gifts! Finally after calling t mobile and writing to the seller I was able to find a fix for my 1 and only gripe I had with this amazing diamond in the rough!I. Got. The. MMS. To. Work!Here is how.1. Go to setting. Mobile data. Access point names. There will be two fields. Tmobile data and t mobile MMS.2. Go to tmobile MMS on and under the mmsc field select and copy the entire string of text.3. Go to the T-Mobile data APN and here paste the string you copied in the Mmsc field.4. Under the APN type field you should see default,supl,hipri. What you need to do is add ,MMS to it. You should see this string default,supl,hipri,mms5. Make sure you save your changes to the APIs so that they take effect (duh) =]My theory is that Huawei is actually super efficient and it doesn\\'t require 2 APIs - one for data and 1 for MMS but since most US phones do that\\'s the info T-Mobile is sending you here.And there you go. Now you have MMS working. Enjoy! Please rate this review if it helped you so that other people could see it as well! I was pretty bummed when I saw that my MMS wasn\\'t working but now I\\'m quite content with everything this phone has to offer! I\\'ll attach images as well for ease of use! Byeee! Very android - after using Samsung tablet, lessons learned were transferrable to phone. Would have preferred clean international version, not AT&T, not T-Mobile or any other carrier\\'s version. Firm believer in buying unlocked phones that are in no way tied to any carrier. great item Excelente producto. The phone works fine but wont hold charge the battery drain very fast, I fully charged night before in the morning the battery only has%30 .it has also over heat problem. I wiil buy again Bought this as a gift for the husband - he loved it. Using it on T-mobile. No issues. Battery life is very decent. The phone comes with GPS/NFC on by default. Please turn them off and battery life will improve. Phone will perform some system updates upon startup - pls let it do so. Build is very high quality. I dont understand when users say there is nothing new in this phone.. It makes calls, it has a very good camera, runs all the apps...best of all has a form-factor that is fits human hands (one of the key reason I bought it). I got it just a few days ago..very satisfied so far..Update: WiFi reception is less robust than my prior Samsung phone. This issue appears to be more pronounced when both Bluetooth and WiFi are ON at the same time. Brilliant! Just the thing for a fella who needs something durable, relatively simple and affordable. Perfect excellent I am truly fasinited with my new toy. It doesn\\'t look like the clumsy phones that many of my friends have but I\\'m still discovering new things that it can doEveryone says it\\'s a good buy. The camera is a lot more than I expected. My daughter loves this phone. Good iphone Awesome This phone is refurbished. So it works great so far (had it for a week). I just wished the listing would have stated that it was refurbished. This my second moto x.This one did not come in the factory original box and and came with a weird charger - the charger works but not as well as my original one. Also, it does not, again doesn\\'t come with the Sim card tool that my factory original did. My son was pleased with his gift. Great phone and absolutely love its performance. Worked fine with Rogers Canada carrier. Excelente Excelente product thank you very much I enjoy the fingerprint addition so when people are nearby I can just touch the home button to unlock my phone without anyone lurking to see me enter my unlock code. The speaker has a problem i think I cannot give this phone high enough praise. It is a beautifully designed device, easily handles even the most demanding apps, and has more features than I will ever use. The reduced Touchwiz interface is a joy to use, and greatly improved over previous versions. I can say without a doubt this is my favorite phone I\\'ve ever owned.I do want to note that this is an international version. As such I was surprised, though I shouldn\\'t have been, to discover upon opening that I\\'d received the Italian version of it. This means the manual and the wall charger are both the Italian versions, too. The seller was kind enough to include an EU to North American adapter so I can plug it in. Initial setup was a breeze, with language selection being one of the first screens upon powering it up. The utilities folder was still named instrumenti, but aside from that localization switched entirely to English without any problems. I read a different review that said they got the French version, so it seems there\\'s no way to know what you\\'ll get until you get it. I still think it\\'s an excellent product and well worth carrying an adapter around with me since my carrier doesn\\'t sell the S6 yet.Five stars! I will wear it as a watch and nothing else. I cant answer calls with it even when connected to bluetooth. I really wanted this product to work as the specs seem to be a good contender against Samsung Galaxy S series. It has everything you can wish for a smartphone but the hardware has serious issues. The unit I receive keeps on getting unresponsive from sleep mode after about 20 to 30 minutes of sleep. Pressing the power button will not wake it up. Suggestions regarding pressing the Vol+ and Power button didn\\'t help. It seems like it just crashed while in sleep mode so the only recourse is open the back panel which holds the SIM and Sd card and press the Reset button for several seconds till it vibrates and restarts. I\\'ve tried upgrading the firmware to different versions (4.2.2, 4.3, 4.4) to no avail. I ended up returning it after two days of battling the issue. The placement of the protruding power button on the side is also a very bad placement if you are using a holster case as the side of any holster case will tend to press the Power button. It never turned on. When I turned to the BLU customer support, they wanted me to return the item to them, with me paying shipping, and use the warranty to have the phone fixed. I\\'m sorry, but if something never worked in the first place, it is not a warranty issue. If they would\\'ve shipped me a new phone and had me ship this back, I probably would\\'ve kept it. Since that didn\\'t happen, they lost a customer. Wonderful phone. The cellphone did not work. The scream was damaged. It looked like used Love the phone. Works great! Would give it 5 stars but didn\\'t come with original box and no accessories as described When I first bought it I bought the wrong version when I was supposed to get the 3 but then decided to just go with it. It was good at first and I loved the apps but then as weeks go by and the phone is downloading more apps, it starts to freeze alot, not a lot of memory and its terrible at camera quality. If you use a lot of social media, suggest getting a much better phone to keep like the LG 9 or Samsung galaxy3 or 4 Just as described Fast shipping Thank you I had it for 2 weeks And now its broken can i request another one out of my warranty Worth the value. Superb features. Item is as described, still working on learning how to use it. It is a wondefull phone in all sense. I am glad that i \\'d choose this phone hello, this came to me as I expected perfect recommend this item and this shop. will apologize for my English is not good Digitizer broke in my pocket. I weigh 140 lbs with a case on the phone. Substandard construction makes it too flexible. Tech supports says I can\\'t even have it fixed by the manufacturer. This phone didnt last a good 6mo beforebitvwent out!!but was still under warranty so got a replacement!!my husband has one he got his from Sprint haven\\'t had any problems with his!!!but over ALL its a great phone!!he\\'s very rough with phones and its still working even with the type of work he does!!!i guess its just not such a goid idea to purchase phones on these sites!!!! way better than my Samsung phone the merchandise is taking too long a month and is much more A1++++++++++++ It\\'s actually a pretty good phone for the money.Upsides - Simple, functional, sound quality was good on calls. Pretty cool that it takes a 64GB microSD card.Downsides - Difficult to root, battery life isn\\'t great (but you\\'d expect that from a smaller battery), the microUSB port got loose after a few months making it difficult to charge. Difficult to complain when it\\'s under $20. Only negative is dropping the connection inside some buildings in NYC on T-Mobile network which doesn\\'t happen on my smartphone so it sounds like it\\'s the phone not the carrier. When you\\'re outside its fine. Gave this to my middle school kid for their 1st phone I\\'m very happy with the purchase! The phone works perfectly, and as I expected. My one small complain is that the top part of the screen kinda edge out of its case, so I occasionally have to push it back in so it\\'s snug. It doesn\\'t come out but starts to edge out, which I\\'m guessing is because the screen was once replaced. I\\'ve replaced a screen in the past and the same thing would happen because some of the glue and snuggness of everything is lost when parts are changed. In any case, its not enough to bother me and I\\'ve got a good case for it, so I\\'m looking forward to lots of time with this phone. For the price it\\'s excellent. I bought this phone and sent it to Jamaica. In less than a month the phone wouldn\\'t turn on. The phone sweat underneath the memory card and damaged the circuit board. This product is not in good, slow and very fragile pin battery, has no spare parts.do not throw your money. Ordered the US VERSION of this unlocked phone as I am moving to Uganda Africa. Product arrived in designated time frame, but box was somewhat damaged...as if it was partially opened on one side. When I opened it, I think I know why. There was an english abbreviated instruction book in the box, but that is ALL that was in english. The phone was in a language I could not at all understand (portuguese maybe...just not sure). I tried to look on-line for a manual to try and change the settings, but since I could not read the screens...it was to no avail.I immediately called Amazon customer service. They were extremely helpful and sent me a return label immediately. I returned to phone the same day, and am awaiting my refund. I ordered the same phone from a different dealer that day also, and to my relief, it is in English, and am hopeful it will work when I get to Africa and obtain my SIM card. thank you Amazon for your help with the return.... first time I have ever had a problem with anything for you. I bought it as a gift it is going out of the country nice phone, I didn\\'t check when it arrived and I send them to India .one is working fine but other is asking for PIN number .Not able to use that phone.what to do. Works awesome! Huge antennae, no TV reception anywhere that I took it.As a cellphone it worked flawlessly while traveling overseas with fantastic battery life. Even though the phone was advertised as unlocked, it was not unlocked. The phone came with an AT&T SIM and worked fine the first time I turned it on. However, when I used my T-Mobile SIM it kept saying \"invalid sim\". I tried it two other GSM sim from a different country too. If you are buying it to use with any other carrier than AT&T please dont buy. With Amazon\\'s great customer service policy, I was able to return it. But doesnt worth all the hassle The screen size is very nice. I wish they made a $300 version for adults. This phone is lacking the guts for adult every day life. Great phone for the kids tho. I have suffered with battery shortage since I start to use smartphones years ago, now this Huawei Mate 2 let me use it for 5 days+ in a single full charge, the quality of the phone is very good as I have been using it for 7 weeks now and it is only $299, for me the battery life is the 1st thing for considering to buy a smartphone, if you have a one of the top smartphone on the market but do not have enough battery to use it, it is just a joke, isn\\'t it? Love it!! This phone freezes and get hot and this was supposed to be a new. I have to pull the battery out to make it work. It is a cheat.The cell is used, even not refurbished.the back cover is broken. A corner lost.the Battery compartment is full of dust.I can\\'t beleive that happend in Amazon. Have been burned before with another company on a different phone. Had to send back. Not this one. Great phone, great price, Great fast service. Color is a bit more feminine than I thought, but it works well in Brazil. Very good item works perfectly fine had it for a while now and no problems have occured. Great seller and fast shipping This phone is the right size and as is fast!! It was purchased for my son\\'s birthday. He is happy with this phone. My son prefers the smaller phones and this works for him as some larger ones like the iPhone 6 and 7 are too big for his taste. I will never own a phone without an Otterbox Defender Series again after 2 years my previous phone looks brand new and the only reason I had to buy this one was because I got a new phone I love my otter boxes OMG ALL PERFECT nice color good size but too basic doesnt hold memory what so ever and its not loud enough .. phone pretty much is good for nothing too slow I love this phone! I am super clumsy with electronics so I couldn\\'t justify spending much money on something I would likely break. I\\'ve had it for about four months and I have no complaints! Great Job I just bought this phone for my daughter and she loves it. The only issue I had is her old phone had a mini sim and this one takes a larger version. So instead of waiting to order a SIM adapter (since ATT and Bestbuy both told me they couldn\\'t help me) I took the matter into my own hands. What I figured out is the SIM 1 goes in the top slot and a tray is below it for SIM 2. So I then side my SIM card in the first slot with the SIM chip facing down, then to hold it in place I put a piece of scotch tape over it. Once you put the battery in the SIM is snug in place.I have a Blu Vivo Air which I love but I have to say for the price this phone is really great. I could have down way worse for the same price. great phone Sound is low quality and the speaker is in the back which is the main reason why I am returning it a few hours after I received it. My old Samsung S3 has much superior sound and the speaker is in the front where it needs to be.The unit came with a tiny instruction booklet that is essentially worthless. It took me a while to figure out how to open the damn thing just to insert the SIM. Great When the phone stopped charging I went to check the serial number in the SIM tray. For my surprise the SIM tray did not have any serial number as is should.Then I checked the SN on the box that came with the phone. I went to the apple site to check the warranty and got the following message?\"We\\'re sorry, but this is a serial number for a product that has been replaced. Please check your information and re-enter your serial number. If your information is correct, you may need to contact us.\"After that I went to check the backup of it on my computer and discovered that the Serial Number did not match with the one on the box and worse than that the apple site tells me that there is no more warranty for this serial number.Now, I have a new iPhone that does not work and does not have warranty. If I have to pay the 150 dolars to have it fixed, it means that I could have bougth a iPhone 4s instead.This is the first time I have problems whe buying on Amazon. I hope there is a way to solve this situation. Whenever i take/place a call, the incoming/outgoing call voice has a low background noise. But if i switch over that same call to speaker option i wont hear any disturbance. Only few complains about battery life from the user After 2 months this phone stopped reading any sim card we used. Would not recommed Gerat LOVE this case! It does have the hole for the home button. And fits my SE perfectly. It also fits the 5s as I tried it on that phone also. The color is beautiful and not super bright. Otterbox Defender is the only case I\\'ve used for my phones and when I recently upgraded to the SE I didn\\'t want to get anything else. But many of the colors I found were 25-40$ and I couldn\\'t believe it when this popped up for such a lower price. I purchased this case and the orange and green real tree for another phone we have. Both came in original Otterbox packaging and arrived quickly. I\\'m very happy we got these and their lower price is awesome. Compared to my original Defender case these are the same quality. great works perfectly fine and in good condition Its awesome smarthphone, light Weight, very thin, fast and Good resolution of its screen and Camera. Q maravilla d telf Item arrived safely and on time.it was very impressive. One of the speakers is broken from water damage, i learned cause i got it with a broken screen also and when i went to get it fixed they told me why complete waste. It did work ,I gave it too my nefphue instead of making it mine . It will be used indeed . I don\\'t see them often so he jumped on itHope he will enjoy it as much as I . Item has a known defect in which sim card 2 stops working which is why there is no warranty. Seller refused to cross ship and wanted to leave me without a phone waiting to replace this one which really wont do much good as its a known issue with the LT10 model. OK Dear seller,I received my phone without earphone and I have serious battery problem. It losing power quickly. Excelente It fullfills all my need great buy except for short battery life buen vendedor lo recomiendo, estoy 100% satisfecho con mi articulo el articulo es como el descrito por el vendedor gracias Received my phone today sooner than expected. Love everything about it. Should have gotten LG sooner. Bye Samsung.... I bought in April at $215. I used to be owner of low-end Pantech Burst to high-end Oneplus One (OPO) device until I broke it. I knew this phone is outdated by 2 years but here is my thought: Comparing to new mid-range phones are currently offering, this device is still a beast!* PROs and impression:- good specs- small bezels- 5.2 inches is great size, fit well in my pockets. Unlike the 5.5 inches OPO- bottom speakers- all high-end, neat features included (QuickRemote!, double tap, NFC, Miracast,...)- Great camera with optical image stabilization!- unique design with all buttons on the back*CONs and suggestion:- plastic, slippery material for the back. Get a case, I suggest Diztronic TPU.- Do NOT buy screen protector, none will fit neatly since there is a slight curve on the sides.- ugly default launcher ^_^ install new one. I\\'m using dodol launcher if you wonder.- bloatware from AT&T. go to settings and disable them.- no expandable storage, no removable batteryIn conclusion, I don\\'t think any sub $250 phone in US can beat this. I just hope the carriers will keep updating Android versions. If this helps, you\\'re welcome. great phone thank you Phone was no good after about 4 months of use. I am so sorry I bought this phone. I would prefer to give zero stars to this sh!t. I bought this unlocked phone for my husband for his birthday and he loves it. It has great features and is very user friendly. Sometimes the touch screen doesn\\'t respond on the first tap, but it is not a huge problem and is probably no worse than any other touch screen phone. Also, since it is a European phone, we couldn\\'t find accessories, such as a silicone case, that are made specifically for it. Other than these minor things, I would highly recommend this product! At this poinlt i would give no stars if it was an option. Well the First phone I Purchased kept resetting itself, and doing a bunch of other crazy stuff. So I returned it and purchased another one hoping the first one was just a dud. Unfortunately the second one is doing the exact same thing. I really need a phone. And don\\'t really want to keep going days at a time without a phone to fix the problem. Guessing I need to take my money else were, since for some reason it won\\'t let me send a message to the seller.... This phone is great and battery autonomy is gorgeous.Thank you guys! My husband is using this phone outside of the US and it works great! Picture quality very nice! I purchased this for my daughter and she is very happy with it as she travels around England taking great pics and sending them back home to us. Easy to switch out sim cards for international phone service as well. I wanted &:searched fox an unlocked phone. This phone was not unlocked. It was carried through a company called\"great calls\" and did not provide service in our area. The entire transaction was a nightmare and had to be unwound. We never were able to use the phone. When I ask for an unlocked phone I expect to be told that I am not receiving what I asked for. Not pleased at all, Phone suckz I got it with a bad battery it even had the purple XXX on it aux cable hole plays music with a scratchy noise can\\'t even get my money back because I used it waste of money and time if u don\\'t get this phone because my review YOURWELCOME Mobile phone appearance at a line still, there is a slight scratches, can accept, but found that the battery is charging when use more than 300 times, for it is not satisfied Nice. Ok for the price. ok Very good ,As with the new machine! good Poor quality control. It was wiped, but was still registered to the prior owner. I contacted the seller (Breed), and they would not replace for another unit. I would not trust this seller. Gracias muy bueno The only problem I had is the screen had a blemish line, but it\\'s a used phone. Other than that no complaints. very good phone I love my Note 2...my second one...it does everything.... note 5-6 cost big $you can buy a refurbished Note 2 for less than $200 and it won\\'t effect your plan per month like adding a store phone for $30 month for 2 years! Decent phone, not a terrible price. It\\'s obviously the first in the series, so there are flaws, but I knew that going into it. I do not chase phone. I love this phone very much especially for the price. This phone has all features that I need; it fits in my pocket with its small size - works great and so was the price. did not work at all. We got two of these from different sellers. Shipping took about 8days and the first one worked great! My bf loves it its one that came in white mine is the \"blue\" more of a teal which I like but the screen sometimes won\\'t come on when I push the side button I have to take out the battery. And my screen freezes a lot but my bf\\'s works 100% great. Don\\'t know what went wrong with mine but I\\'d still buy again. Although unlocked it works only with USA. Does not work in Asia Do not order this phone as it does not work with Verizon. I\\'ve spent more on IT support and working with Verizonvto try and get my phone working, I wish I would have just bought a phone through Verizon! Phone will not email more than one person at a time, phone will not show if you have missed calls or messages, phone will not sync with outlook calendar! greetingI am writing to inform you that the phone galaxy sm- g800h I received is not dual sim, and I have accomplished in various page and this galaxy s5 mini model is dual sim.I want to know that you can do for me. because the phone does not work for what I buy . and on another chace he had ship this model and dual sim.Thank First, the description says N910A (AT&T version) but actually what shipped was the N910T (T-Mobile version). That being said, I\\'m using it on AT&T so the bands are 100% compliant with AT&T\\'s network (I get full LTE speeds), and the upside is that the N910T ships with an unlocked bootloader (for those interested in rooting and that sort of thing). I\\'m quite pleased with my mistake, because after some research the N910T is definitely the phone I should have been looking for.I cannot speak highly enough of the condition of the phone. I\\'m picky and I cannot tell it has ever been used. I feel like either the screen was protected by a screen protector or was entirely replaced; either way I cannot distinguish it from a new phone. There is not a scratch, smudge, or crack to be found.The product shipped in a non-OEM box with an OEM charger/USB cord and white Apple-looking headphones. I\\'m not sure if normally more tips are included for the S-Pen, but I only got the tip that came in the pen. All accessories also appeared brand new wrapped in plastic.I see some complaints of bloatware, which are valid (T-Mobile bloatware in my case) but it doesn\\'t take much to go through and disable those apps. SD card support means I\\'m not worried about storage space; I have a 64GB card and most of my storage-hogging apps (i.e. Kindle and Zinio) are able to be moved to the SD card.Update: This phone is still awesome. I recommend getting a Samsung MicroSD card if you find yourself interested in the expandable storage, as I initially used a SanDisk and had lots of issues with the card unmounting and apps moved to the SD not working. I read up on some android forums and saw some people had issues with non-Samsung cards (don\\'t ask why). I switched to\\xa0Samsung 64GB EVO Class 10 Micro SDXC Card with Adapter up to 48/MB/s (MB-MP64DA/AM)\\xa0and have not had a single issue in about 4-5 months of use. Okay i love the phone itself, but i hate that they tried to sell me a used one especially when it contains a multitude of sensitive personal information from the previous owner. Epic Fail Blackberry, and you should probably notify you legal department that your technicians are not properly wiping the phones and that they are trying to sell used phones as new ones... anyway try again My hotspot never worked. And can\\'t update my cell 5.2 lollipop 2 sad Totally satisfied with my order. The package arrived almost instantly and the product was up to my highest expectation. I am very glad to have such an amazing product as Samsung Galaxy Note in addition to my other gadgets. The Note is very handy while traveling by plane. Not bulky and the screen wide enough to watch even movies. :) Recommend! Recommended seller. I loved my smart phone. Thanks. IThis was one of the first phones that would access web easily but this one did not work has problems Excellent, to date I can say it\\'s very good product. It\\'s a good product. I got it brand new. Everything is fine except for the battery life but I can\\'t hate on it because thats how it is with any smart phone. Other than that its a good phone and i recomend it! In an effort to better control monthly expenses, I switched to this net 10 phone. I have had two android based phones (2.2 and 2.3) and a couple of blackberries. This phone had great battery life and very good reception. It is very light and has a type of plastic on the sides that will prevent it from easily slipping out of your hand. The MP3 player is nice, but I haven\\'t found any equalizer settings...the sound is still good though. It isn\\'t a smart phone, but is is a great little text phone. The browser works for basic things, like a quick email check. The camera is fine for quick snap shots and seems to do pretty well in average indoor lighting. If you live in a CDMA area with limited GSM service like I do, and you want to go the Net10 route, this is a good phone, especially for the price! There is a newer version of this phone available for Straight Talk (R375c) that has better screen resolution and better web browser capabilities, but I haven\\'t seen it available for Net10. For now, this phone is just fine. Phone very good! It was great..a true find for the money.My son is truly happy with his gift. meets my every need i totally love it I love this phone...this is my second Blu phone because I wanted to upgrade. The quality as well as the price is unbelievable. Wish it came with a charger. item shape not to good ,but good enoth for collection This is replacing my Galaxy S4 and lives up to the hype. No problems transferring phones with Consumer Cellular, I merely took the sim card from my S4 and put it into the S7 and I was ready to go, no hassle. Battery life seems to be much better than the S4 plus I like the fingerprint log in although sometimes it won\\'t recognize it making it frustrating. I end up having to use the draw pattern. Overall a nice phone. Amazing phone! love it :-) Easy to use. Has a lot of apps, good display. I don\\'t much data so can\\'t tell you on that. Battery doesn\\'t last long, lags a little. Overall good phone I love it Excellent Smartphone Wawww!!! Great product. So beautiful The phone met & continues to both meet & exceed my expectations! It was a very easy set up and is faster and more intuitive than expected. I have been totally satisfied to this point and would definitely recommend this phone. My son\\'s phone was so old his work apps wouldn\\'t work on it any longer so he asked for a new phone for Christmas. When I ordered this phone I expected it to take a week or more. But I think it showed up in 4 days. Much faster than I expected. The phone was loaded and up and running in less than an hour. My son never wanted to get rid of his old phone - he was happy with it. But since he got this one he\\'s realized that he loves this one even more. Newer and more features. I was just what we wanted. Great shipping and a really good deal. I\\'d buy from them again. EXCELENTE I have read many reviews who h say that the phone gets a weaker signal than the at&t or the T-Mobile version of the phone which S are me a little but I decided to buy the phone anyway. I got the phone and I compared it\\'s signal with my S6 Edge at&t version and this international version did show less bars but I believe it\\'s because it\\'s programmed slightly differently but the strength of the signal is the same if not better. I noticed that is some places where my at&t version couldn\\'t load stuff because of a weak signal this international version loaded it my much better, also the phone came with the factory seal untouched, no fake one on top of it One of the biggest mistakes I did is to buy this phone on Amazon. Till date since buying the phone in early July I have not been able to place more than 5% of my calls and still have not received a single call on this phone. All the calls drop each and every time. And when i do receive a call not able to pick it up. The dialler functionality to receive calls is horrible. I tried calling motorolla for help regarding this issue and I was told to do a hard reset on the device which I did but the problem still persists.Shame on Motorolla and Amazon to sell such horrible devices. I received this phone in excellent condition. I ordered. This for my daughter and she is very pleased amd excited. It was a perfect gift to someone. thank you Yes I love it...works great ..is fast..gold is fancy! I\\'m still terrified to carry it without a case..but a clear one works fine Very nice put the chip in, turned it on and it is done. It is running since then. No issues. The person I gave it i svery happy with the large keys. Nice disposable phone for the price. Very good, Great phone! Love this phone... It was everything I expected..the camera is nice and the battery is good... Good Good sell good iPhone thankyou.......... Good phone Case is of poor quality. Feels cheap and edges feel unfinished. Mirror is faded, has scratches all over, and terrible in quality. The card door feels flimsy and like it will break if I open it too far. Returning, not worth the money. I purchased this phone about a month ago for my wife. She has a Samsung Note 3 a flagship phone from 2013, which is still running perfectly fine, but decided to get this for her to test the world of unlocked phones. A couple of years ago the mid range phone market was non existent, fast forward to 2016 the selection can be mind boggling.This review will be a comparison between the two phones and her experience. BTW my carrier is T-Mobile and coincidentally they have refurbished Note 3\\'s for $199.Features/Specs/Performance:Both have fairly large screens. The Vivo 5 coming in at 5.5\" (720p) while the Note 3 at 5.7\" (1080p) super amoled. Looking at the screens side by side she says can\\'t really tell the difference in sharpness, both screens are vivid and vibrant with color. However, I Vivo 5 does get a bit brighter. The Note 3 has a stylus, while the Vivo 5 doesn\\'t.Both have 32GB of internal storage and 3GB of RAM, the Vivo has an 8 core Mediatek processor vs the Snapdragon 800.Both running Android Lollipop (Note 3 upgraded from KitKat) with their respective skins, I\\'m hoping BLU keeps it\\'s promise of Marshmallow. My wife grew accustomed to Touchwiz, so I download Touchwhiz Apex Launcher from Google Play to keep her Android experience fairly the same.Camera: Both sport 13MP rear shooters, in good light both produce very nice images. I would give the edge to BLU because of the software and options for full manual control. The front facing camera on the Note 3 is 3MP while the Vivo 5 has a 5MP, both are just good at best.Performance: Both performed equally well, both are very fluid, smooth and no lags at all. Her daily tasks include...social media, phones calls, texts, Google Calendar, Cozi, Photo Editing apps, Web Browser and online shopping. She also dabbles with Video Editing with an app called KineMaster and both phones handle HD video with ease.In conclusion, today the market is saturated with a ton mid range unlocked phones and the BLU Vivo 5 is this one of them. It\\'s aimed at users that do not need the top of the line specs and hardware but is still able to provide full functionality. Would I recommend this phone to that type of user? ABSOLUTELY! The phone does not work well. Sometimes usable sometime not. The phone work ok. You have to press down hard to navigate through the icons. I bought it for my 10 yr old so it\\'s ok for a starter phone. I disliked this product because I bought this phone for my boyfriend. The day we received it, we turned the phone on and the screen was purple and black. You can\\'t see anything on the screen. Can\\'t even see the screen to power It on and off. It was a waste of $312. great ! I\\'m heavily impressed with the speed and quality from the Axon so far. Not only does it outperform my previous LG G4 in Antutu bench tests, but the overall interface feels unobtrusive, natural and true to android (where I\\'ve found LG\\'s to be a bit cumbersome). When I first held the device I felt it was a bit long, but I adjusted to the screen size surprisingly quickly. I\\'m also surprised at how much of a difference the 8MP front facing camera makes. As a casual snapchat user, I\\'ve actually had people ask me what phone I\\'m using for pictures.Overall, I\\'m very happy with the device. Looks like the G4 (which I paid much more for) is going to remain in the drawers. This phone is less than 2 months old and it has already died. it keep trying to open and cannot. It is very frustrating. It\\'s all i want... Great.. and so beatiful.. A few weeks ago you buy this phone and everything is fine just the aux input does not work donot I can do not work for me since I bought. Nothing to be excited about Love it works great the phone is uesd good . it is not a new phone , the box`s seal not Originally. And there is not Black Hard Shell Cover for me. I love it Males phone calls on ATT 3 G network Best phone It came broken Had to get the camera fixed This is the right phone for me I have used HTC phones for years. I love this phone. I didn\\'t get the M8 because I couldn\\'t afford it. It doesn\\'t matter to me because this one is still an upgrade from what I had. The phone was very easy to set up on straight talk. I love this phone and it\\'s so easy to set up your personal preferences. I was lost with the Samsung 3 that I kept only for 2 months. No dan señales del estado de mi pedido, habra llegado??, ya me lo envian??... nada que puedo hacer respondan Proveedor This is the first time I have used straight talk and it seems to be a good phone so far. I have no idea how to use the dual sim part of the phone. I like the phone. It was just what I was looking for in an upgrade. Yet, I was disappointed to know that the reason why the image of the phone in the above photo does not show the front of the screen; because it\\'s actually an AT&T phone! The AT&T logo is on the front of the screen, and I was expecting to use the phone on verizon network. I went with another company besides ATT using a sims card since it needed one. Disappointed that the seller didn\\'t specify these phones are programed by ATT and come in ATT boxes. FYI. But it does work with a sims card and I haven\\'t had any problems with it. Thank the Lord. softwere pesimo. i really like the iphone 5s, i can reach everything on the screen with my thumb. I am wondering about the future of Apple since the death of Steve Jobs though. They are involved with Dr Dre now and I heard they are going to make bigger phones, something Steve Jobs was against. Guess we will see. I am from Venezuela, the phone is in excellent condition, is the best purchase I have made, arrived in perfect condition at the place of shipment, recommend WE HAVE 3 OF THESE PHONES AND WE NEEDED A REPLACEMENT. WE COULDNT GET IT AT THE VERIZON STORE. AMAZON HAD IT, WE GOT IT IN 3 DAYS I CALLED VERIZON WITH THE SN# PUT THE BATTERY IN AND IT WORKED. IT WORKS ON OUR EXISTING PLAN NO EXTRA FEES. IT\\'S NOT A SMART PHONE BUT ITS GOOD FOR CALLING AND TEXTING GOOD QWERTY KYBD IT FITS IN YOUR POCKET AND IT\\'S DURABLE. Bought this phone on Amazon as new and got this phone in open box (resealed), you can see sticker is tampered. its not brand new returning this product, this is the first had problem with amazon. The product was fine. It was the delivery people that messed things up. Very nice man and really understanding. I checked in with T-Mobile to make sure the problem is not the Sim Card. We put a new one, problem was not solved. Then, we made sure the phone is unlocked. However, T-Mobile was not able to help solving this problem with the connection/reception.I am not able to use this phone in the United States due to lock of connectivity. T-Mobile advised me the phone must have a different frequence most likely for Europe or Asia. I am not happy with this purchase. VERY GOOD I usually don\\'t complain if something isn\\'t too bad messed up, but this phone came with a really bad crack in the screen and a slight crack in the bottom. The back is also badly scrapped up! It didn\\'t even come with a charger! Anybody know why the volume speaker icon blacks out as i try to touch it?.. If this isn\\'t annoying enough, poorly engineered volume control settings as I tried over a year how to fix this issue. Every time I try touching the icon speaker to increase loud speaker,, the touchscreen goes black,, and i can\\'t seem to find anything in settings to fix the issue. Think I may go back to the nokia ph.. sell this one here Does not stay charged, shuts down unexpectedly at inopportune times. This iPhone is not unlocked. Just bought this product and it does not work with my carrier in Brazil. What a shame! Great Value for the money. Fast, clean and simple! Phone did not work right and the seller took care of problem fast happy with result Worked great thanks Amazon When I first brought this phone I thought it was the perfect business phone. I have now had it for about 6 months now and I realize this phone isn\\'t all that it\\'s cracked up to be. It exits you out of apps radomly, sometimes apps freezes, in the age of technology where people use a lot of social media websites for business alll of the social media apps on here is limited and doesn\\'t run well all, trying to watch videos, seminars or anything can be a hastle when trying to fast forward it it exits you out a lot. Sigh I loved it for the first 3 weeks but just like any other not so good relationship once it settled down on me it start showing me it\\'s true colors.But I do looooove the keyboard the size and the look of the phone. The image of blackberry screams out bussiness but the functions doesn\\'t. I used to want a blackberry soooo bad for the longest due to that thought and it was always my favorite phone but now after this because of the productivity of the phone I\\'m going to have to go else where to get a phone I would rather have an I phone and android now but I need something with a keyboard that\\'s bomb like this lol. It\\'s an iphone, what more does one need to say! I upgraded to the iPhone 6 when it came out (I needed to test a few apps on the larger screen) and then last year I thought, \"If I get the Plus, I can have an even better reading/watching experience\". After 6 months, I\\'m ditching my 6S+ and I\\'m loving this phone! It\\'s so small and light it almost feels like a toy, and I don\\'t need a case to keep from dropping it. I love it and the camera quality is great. Horrible cell,no sale to enybody enymore Good phone for an extra. Love this iPhone!! Super fast shipping! 😊 excelente producto. near mint condition. Better than was described. Working great. liked The cell I arrived on time and in accordance with all its accessories, the software also had to program in Spanish. This is a great phone. I had upgraded from the Xperia TL and this phone screen is bigger and in my opinion runs faster and smoother. The phone is presently running on Kit Kat. Only small issue is that it came with the language set on Spanish out of the box. amazing phone to have. i love it. except for the battery drain issues Wonderful for the price thanks good price I do not recommend this seller. The phone has problema since I bought it. When you make o receive calls the other person did not listen and now sometimes tve touch screen does not work well. I contact HTC and they told me the problem os the phone. A-1! very nice. worked as advertised. Full of features, you may want to carry an extra battery. WiFi did not connect right out the box. Never could get a picture text and now won\\'t work at all. Wasted our money on this. Awesome phone, mine came and there were no scratches on it and it was 100% fully functional. An ok cell phone for travelers. Excellent item This phone is not good, started very good for some months and now is problem.wish if i could get a refund on this phone. Everything is perfect! the phone is working fine,but the earphone and its accessary that came with the phone doesn\\'t seem to be original earphone, it looks chinese and the production is not good. LOVE the Droid mini and for the price from this seller, you cannot beat it! The specs are great, the phone size/weight is comfortable, and after being an Android user that \"tried\" an Iphone, I am super glad to be back to Android.The seller shipped quickly, packaged the product well and it was as described! many thanks! Very good service of amazon as well as the phone. Thanks a lot. hello good morning my friends Prompt delivery as promised so far so good This phone is huge! doesn\\'t fit in pocket and has poor instructions. (Can\\'t figure out how to turn on the light).Also, the phone won\\'t work with my sim card which works in other phones. This was a total waste of money for us. We can\\'t use it. Really would like to post that while purchasing this phone I saw all the review that this phone will work out internationally and it\\'s unlocked.... but when I came to India this phone doesn\\'t work..... Excellent phone fast, good responsive and features, 4 stars cause can be better in shape and weigth but es good for the price As good as new and I saved a bundle! This was advertised as unlocked, however, it is locked on AT&T network. This is a terrible phone, both my children have one and they constantly have to reboot the phone I loved it! I only need this phone for my roaming SIM card and I am very satisfied. 😍😍😍 I am not happy with the phone. I wish now that I had gotten the S7 instead. My son jumped in a pool with original phone, this was a replacement. Phone in great condition and works great, not so much for the battery though! Wouldn\\'t hold a charge. For such a low price I wasn\\'t expecting much, but much to my surprise this HTC phone turned outto be a pleasant surprise. Unfortunately, This cell phone is not the original AT&T package. Not the Orange one, but a blue one with a SAMSUNG Logo. The Battery is empty, but is not new, produced in 2010. Handset is new, but also not with original package.The phone have no scratch but smells bad, doesn\\'t have the new one\\'s taste. But it is unlocked and seems new. I\\'m a little bit confused why amazon sell the fake/renew one? How do you take control of the quality? So i give amazone.com a bad feedback! Everything great good product great price fast shipping i dropped it on the floor and the phone broke not the case the phone what a poj One of the more current HTC phones and it worked smoothly just as I expected Will never buy anything again. I received it and did not work. Neither one of them. Then returned them both and they received it. Never got my refund of 89.00 back, like they said it would happen. Love this phone! And current price for this is almost a steal. Ended up buying this for my wife and also my mom. I have had the phone for over 24 hours so far. Great phone. Good sound, good voice, fast O.S. Good signal reception all around, though in N. NJ that is not really a problem.I charged it initially at home with the included AC charger, and at the office hooked it up with the included USB cable and saw the phone charging while I was playing with it and synching up my calendar.I swapped my SIM card from the old phone, (HTC Hermes/ATT 8525), to this one and it worked right away. ATT mediaNet needed no configuration even though I had only added data/texting to my account from online only minutes before. WiFi works well in my home. This is my first time using ATT MediaNet so I can\\'t really comment, but it helped me compare prices on a microwave oven from inside a store. Amazon got an order for a microwave once I got home and I saved over $50. It is nice not hunting for a WiFi signal as I used to do. Glad I finally succumbed to paying for ATT\\'s service. I am not comfortable with Nokias included browser yet, but it seems to work well. I may try Opera.I can work with office documents and synch up with my outlook calender faster than I could with my old HTC/ATT Win 6.1 smart phone. Nokia PC Suit is leagues ahead of MS Active Synch, and puts Motorola\\'s software to the shame it deserves.Folks that play with it are amazed at how fast the phone responds when selecting applications. Instant response instead of a second or so wait as many Windows based phones have.The one issue I have had is I can not get the included headset to work properly as a headset. I suspect it is intended as just a music headset, but no matter what I do I can not get loud enough sound out of it, and the manual has no mention of it other than showing where to plug it in. When you attach the headset the phone asks what you want to use it as. Whether I select headset or headphones it does not seem to work well. The phone will warn you to use the phone mic. I recommend getting a better headset/headphones when you buy the phone, I am doing that right after I post this. Maybe with more use I can sort it out. I only tested it by calling my office voice mail, since I did not want to annoy friends and family by making them guinea pigs.This brings up the 3.5 mm jack the phone has. I am often on support calls. Sometimes for hours at a time. (Yes, I am an I.T. peon). I did not consider this when thinking about the phone, but there are NO standard headsets that use 3.5 jacks that I can find, they almost all use 2.5. The headsets that do use 3.5 are either iPhone style earbuds, which I find very uncomfortable, or ones intended for PC gaming, which use TWO plugs and are not usable on a phone. Not an over-the-ear one in the bunch. So I am stuck using bluetooth, which loses power fast and can\\'t last long anough, or getting a clunky adapter so I can use a standard 2.5 mm headset, or trying an iphone earbud style headset that has the microphone in the wire, not on a boom, which has poor voice quality compared to a boom and hurts my ears after a few minutes. Slightly disappointing.I do like having the hidden qwerty keyboard, as I did with my prior phone, so that it is there when needed for documents, email, texting etc, but out of the way otherwise. Someday I may try a tablet-style phone, like the E71 or a blackberry, but this works well for me.One big reason I got this phone is the number pad for dialing. While touch screens are nice, having them as the only interface to the phone is a mistake.If you need to dial a number fast, such as 911, it can be very tough to do. Number pads are better, and if the primary use of the phone is as, well, a PHONE, it makes sense. It fits easily into my shirt pocket. I do not need to hang it on my belt and feel like Batman as I would with a tablet PDA.But touch screens are useful. I think this phone would benefit from one for navigating the menus, it would probably be faster than using the various keys. The screen could be larger, there would be room to extend it if Nokia moved the logo from the top of the phone.There is a lot left to play with on this, like the multiple profiles, etc. So there is still more to learn on this.But all-in-all, even with the headset issue, this is the best phone I have had yet, whether smart-phone or not. If this is an indication of where Nokia is going, they are going in the right direction. it\\'s been 3 days since I got it, screen already showing problems, don\\'t know if it\\'s factory defect or they drop it right before sending it to me.... I am going to return it before it gets worse People expecting a fire-breathing flagship killer for 50 bucks are likely to be disappointed, but for an essentially disposable phone with limited smart capabilities, it is fine. Works well for actual phone calls, SMS messaging and other communication tasks. OK for checking e-mail and limited casual browsing, but I am not in a hurry to try to use it to replace all of my other computing devices. \"4G\" HSPA+ should be fast enough for the non-streaming-video crowd, and it addresses the major shortcoming of its predecessor, which was rather limited storage space (although a Marshmallow upgrade would have taken care of that easier). An ideal phone to take on vacation, and if you accidentally drop it into a tourist attraction it won\\'t be the end of the world. Travelers take note: worked well in every country in Europe I\\'ve taken it to.For people who observe that the response can be a bit sluggish, you have to allow the phone to complete all of its start up tasks before diving in to do any serious stuff. I have a few apps that always start with the device, such as an anti-malware scan, and for the first few minutes it is noticeably crawling along. After that it seems to run just fine. And it probably helps to have smaller fingers - the screen is not exactly in the \"phablet\" size range. I\\'ve had the phone for one month and I\\'m already thinking new phone.What do I like:Nice screen. Size of phone. Dual sim capabilities.What I don\\'t like:Very little storage space. Picture quality not good. Now the phone freezes when I try to take a pic from the chat screen. I have to do a battery pull to get it to restart.Seriously Samsung I\\'m beginning to lose confidence in your manufacturing. Very capable smartphone and faster than its rivals, smartphones with processor of 800 Mhz doesn\\'t even come close in performance. Didnt work to make or receive calls Those one is good I bought it but it doesn\\'t work with the unlock smartphone I bought because the phone cannot be activated here in the US. Screen went out in less than three hours of having it. Wouldn\\'t recommend the product. Phone was sold under Verizon as the carrier. when I called Verizon to activate the device they said the IME # was not a Verizon phone and would not activate the phone. It is larger than I had expected but you get used to it. It is a little heavier than expected but it is a very solid feel to it. The battery life is shorter than expected but not a huge issue. The big screen is very easy on the eyes and the touch screen is very sensitive to the touch. The camera okay but has issues in low light, but any camera is only as good as the photographer using it. I\\'m as happy with my BLU as I was with my old Samsung. For the money, I will be replacing this BLU with another BLU when the time comes. Works great! Easy setup. Low end product and appropriately noted as no warranty. I would not recommend this defective product as it is not supported by the seller. It\\'s all good The product exceeded my expectations! I will be using Amazon a lot more often Love the phone. Simple, elegant and powerful. At half the price of an iPhone it\\'s a great alternative and a good way of getting into our android without the bloat. No replaceable battery or memory add on makes for a compact phone. Try it still has a decent screen size and your virtually guaranteed the latest updates when they arrive. I picked up the international version and I\\'m using AT&T when in the US. I can only access 3G/HSPA but that\\'s plenty quick for me and when I\\'m in Europe I get all the frequencies. Sweet handset, awesome price! Nice. This phone has many issues. The wifi goes on and off constantly, the GPS cannot locate or track, the battery dies very quickly, and it is very slow. Had this phone for a few weeks and it is driving me crazy. I am ordering a new iPhone 7... Very nice phone, it works flawlessly so far. This item arrived defective me, and as it has lost money guarantee. I bought two (2) and with different vendors and both arrived damaged. I recommend NOT BUY. IT IS A SCAM .. el equipo llego dañado ni prendia se supone que era nuevo y creo que era reconstruido bueno perdi el dinero Good phone, minor scratches and dents but works perfect. excelente Ended up trading this item for an item of far greater cost. The person to receive this item is ecstatic with it. Excellent for the value, wish it had a camera butother than that, wish instruction for we chat were in English not Chinese so i can\\'t use it if we\\'re in en it would be a five. It\\'s by no means water resistant not even from light rain. This phone was my first smart phone, and every time I smash mine, drop it in boiling water, or urinate on it by accident, I buy this phone again. It doesn\\'t have all the bells and whistles, but it does everything a smart phone should.It is a great phone that came shipped perfectly, no flaws, had a charger and manuals. I bought a Trident case for it, and it is amazing, I have reviewed that as well.I have used this phone for years. It messages, calls, is lightning fast on the internet, and doesn\\'t have any OS issues. It is durable, and will withstand the daily tumble and minor spills. Does not do well in the dishwasher...Buy this phone for sure. It is a inexpensive simple phone that does all that most people will need. For the price, it is the best deal I have found. Weary nice cell. Working with two SIM card . Fast delivery thank you . this product is excellent. based on the price range you can\\'t beat this deal I\\'ve had my Casio Rock for about 5 years. Love it. Thought I\\'d try to find another to use as a spare, but they no longer make the Rock. I searched and searched for the Boulder, which is the replacement for the Rock, and finally found one. You have to be very careful about buying cell phones on the internet because there are retailers who claim to be selling new products, but often they arrive without batteries, backs, chargers, etc. The Rock will always be my favorite because it is indestructible (went through the wash once with no problems). The Boulder has less rubber and may be not as tough, but it works just fine, holds a charge for quite a while and I have no complaints. You won\\'t find any of these fine Casio phones at Verizon, so if you want one--and you should--try this retailer. You can\\'t beat the price ($79.) plus a few more bucks for the chargers. Very good for price.... excelente no it this not work black scree. Awesome Phone. I\\'m not into the Big phones its much better carrying around a smaller lightweight device. , looks retro and its light weight too. Plenty of space for me. Simple phone with enough for your essential apps. I have had this phone since June of 2009 and have had little trouble with it. I did buy it unlocked here off of Amazon, not sure of the company though. I have had occasional freezing from it, which is the only reson it didn\\'t get a 5 star from me. I have read previous reviews of how it doesn\\'t support internet even in 3G, or that the picture messaging does not work. I have used the web browser in normal service with only 2 bars before. While extremely slow, it does work, so I really don\\'t know where the \"not working in 3G\" came from. Also, i have sent, and recieved Multi Media Messages (MMS) throughout my time of having this phone. The e-mail client and IM client also functions properly. Overall, this is a great phone and I highly reccommend it to anyone looking for a cheap, yet pleasing phone. Phone was better than expected, would order again from seller I ordered a new phone and they sent me a re-furbished one.The ring level is too low so I miss 1/2 the calls. The ringer cannot be set for individual callers (such as my wife so I never miss that call).The hands free speaker is not capable of picking up my voice so can\\'t do direct hands free.That alarm has the most terrible wake up music and instead of gentle waking you, it jolts you awake and although there are choices they are all not suitable. You have to wake up to set the doze button. the minimum alarm you can set is 5 minutes.The worst part is that the phone keeps making a small ding sound telling me the phone has some message . . . which usually is some program that wants to read my e-mails, my contacts or my location. The phone will not tell me which program it is nor can I set a different tone for each program.Want to go crazy? The time is always one hour ahead when roaming and no way to correct it! I did try to change GMT and set it for the cell provider time but neither worked.The camera is workable as long as a flash is not needed. The flash is not coordinated with the shutter so all flash pictures are very dark and not usable. There is no picture stabilization so many pictures come out blurred. the phone works great, i\\'m really happy i bought it What a nice and elegant phone!! At first, I had difficulty choosing between this model and the Edge one. Finally, I choose versatility and a practical phone. Edge is fashion, but in the daily use, I felt it was going to be bigger and uncomfortable to hold/carry.This phone is very fast, just what I wanted. 4G in Argentina is fast, so I can netsurf at high speed. I\\'m very happy with this purchase! Great Samsung product! I saved $150 ordering this from here rather than buying at AT&T, it arrived in a factory sealed box, and I have had no issues with this. The employees as the AT&T store were very curious where I had bought this phone, and said they had not seen this color S6 available.Took about 15 minutes to get a SIM card installed & the phone set up. I love this phone! Good Excelente celular Phone was as described works and keeps track of mine activities with calendar option product is reliable and light weight mom loves her phone! Nice phone, everything as described best phone I have had so far Great phone! Thank you! Phone cracks very easily, after first crack the bottom half stopped working. The first 4 days I had it the speakers didnt work so I had to factory reset it. Other than those problems, I really like the phone. Gets what I need done and the camera was great when I could use it. Love it, just what I expected! V.G Great product. Period. Best phone i have had in a long time. Love the speed in searching mode. :) Arrived on time, so far so good. No encoutering any problems. This BB works well. Not great. The Bold 9780 works much better, faster, and has much better photo quality. Both might freeze once in a while but this will do it more often. If you don\\'t mind spending twice as much on a phone, I suggest you the Bold model. But if your budget is tight this phone will do it. This phone is a bit pricy, should be $120 for what it is, but BB are generally overpriced. This is a great phone for a person that loses phones constantly and wants a working BB. Or if you let your phone fall a lot or let it go for a dive in the pool (even though it will not work later). But if you are a careful person I suggest you buy a Bold model, take good care of it, and enjoy its benefits, avoid headaches, and take very good pictures. I value greatly a good camera on a phone because these pictures will last forever if you save them properly. And it is always better to have a good quality camera. Imagine taking the picture of your life (with a celebrity, or friends, or idk who) with a bad camera. Not worth risking. The curve is ok but the Bold is better. The bold is twice the price but twice as better (not perfect thought). good Price-quality relation. Great battery life...nice audio and signal antennae.... The product was received in great condition and works fine. I used this phone only a couple months and it froze. Nobody could help me in the US because this phone was build for Asia and doesn\\'t covered by US Warranty. Now it\\'s just a brick. Please stay away from ordering this product! Or read carefully about warranty. Doesn\\'t have the feel and response of a higher end phone like Samsung or LG The battery life its too short, I bought this item for my wife, and she must charge the battery daily, and the she only speak a few minutes on a daily basis. A new battery should have more power life.Please notice that you can\\'t view you tube videos if you have an internet plan, since this cell phone does not allow you.If you are looking for a smart phone, spend a little more and buy HTC, Iphone or BB.Also, you must buy a power adapter, since the connector has been made for Europe. It is not working. It only worked for just 2 calls.I am returning it Hello! I am from Venezuela, I received the phone two weeks ago due to heavy delays with the company transfers, I have problems with coverage, I thought it was the phone company and change and still present the problem, call me and the phone appears as despite this off on and when I call and attend the call is dropped, refer to the telephone companies and I mentioned it was the phone problem. But later both receive the phone and I get no options habialitado to contact the seller ... Is there any way to report my problem to you help me? ...thanks NOT OVERLY FAMILIAR WITH VERBAGE. great phone ... just to say that have and great battery on the phone,this is normal use... A great phone for the money. If you don\\'t have to have the latest and greatest then check this phone out. Only missing 3gb(it has 2) ram as compared to other top flight phones. This is my 2nd Blu phone the 1st one was the Blu studio 5.5 and I returned it right away I didn\\'t like it . this one is a big improvement def a great phone . the battery life on this phone is great lasts more than 24 hours with regular usage text , you tube internet, social networks and such. the resolution is nice and bright . the camera is the only thing I don\\'t like , but who cares about that I don\\'t. Use a camera if you like to take pictures. overall its a great phone . In the box it comes with a screen protecter and a silicone case . I love the headphones and charger it complements the phone . I did a lot of research before I purchased this phone and I\\'m glad I bought it .I was using a Samsung galaxy i717 before this And I love blu life view better .Update : I\\'ve been using the blu life view phone for close to 1 month and still love this phone , battery life is awesome don\\'t need to carry no chargers , and a very strong phone . I strongly recommend this phone One of the best buys on a phone! Nice phone, has everything I need and cost if quarter of newest model. Works as a charm. Excellent quality It is a great phone has all the amenities it doesn\\'t allow visual voicemail? but overall I love it. I would recommend it to anyone. WAS NOT UNLOCKED!! Works as you would expect cant say much else its an iphone excelente Can hardly believe this cell was used. Took it to my Sprint Store, along with my damaged one, had all my contacts transferred & I was set to go. Very reasonably priced. I love it. M.C. Bentheimer Exelelente Great quality i phone. The phone is okay. It was for my teen daugher. Just for calling & texting. However, the seller neglected to say the phone is no longer manufactured, packaged it in a box for another phone, and sent it without directions. Because it was to be a gift it would have been nice to have had this info included in the description prior to my purchasing it. Had I known I simply would have passed over it. When I contacted them about it they were cold about it. Obviously their customers mean little to them. They did offer to give me a refund, but, it was too late. Christmas was here. I wouldn\\'t have had a replacement in time to have it under the tree. Honesty up front would have prevented the whole thing. Oh and they provided a PDF online for the directions. As if I should have to look that up. No. TELEFONO USADO, LLEGÓ SIN LOS TORNILLOS TRASEROS, EN 15 DIAS DE USO, EL PIN DE CARGA Y PANTALLA DAÑADOSUSED \\'\\'PHONE, NO SCREWS CAME BACK, THE PIN CHARGING AND DISPLAY DAMAGED Nice but doesnt have Marshmallow update yet ..waiting for it I completely LOVE my new iPhone!! It came with no scratches and right on time! No complaints at all. It was unlocked and I had no issues with connecting with my carrier. Thank you soooo much 👍 awesome phone! got here quick too! very impressed. i was a little nervous paying so much online ar first....but when my package arrived i was very relieved. thank you love these phone, one of the best i ever had I\\'m very upset I spent $214 on this phone and I can\\'t hear anyone when I\\'m on a call Wonderful I can\\'t say whether or not it\\'s a good smart watch as mine wouldn\\'t turn on and I returned it. Amazing. Love the battery life, Camera and fingerprint sensor ( Not to mention the sheer design!) Mine was shipped from China. The phone was made by cheap materials. It looks cheap. The ear piece does not fit the phone. The seller did not have any extra one to replace mine. I have AT&T, therefore the reception is great. I do not use much Apps. The phone has been working fine. it okey Great case! I have dropped my phone multiple times while in this case and it has definitely held up! Good quality. Fits phone well. The only thing I don\\'t like about it is the setup for the headphone jack protector, but that\\'s pretty typical among any case that covers the headphone port. Amazing,awesome. I recommend it completely Phone developed a problem with the microphone after about 10-11 months of regular use, with the microphone completely failing within days of the 1-year warranty being over. Tried hard resetting the phone, upgrading the software to Android 6.0.1, but the problem could not be resolved.Contacted Sony support and after plugging in the IMEI their website says my phone was not under warranty, even though it was within a year of my purchase date from Amazon.Also had regular problems with SMS messages on this phone - messages received from people would periodically be in all Chinese characters (copied and pasted to Google Translate and the translation made absolutely no sense). I also had quite an unreliable time receiving MMS group text messages, with some responses not being received, or in the incorrect order. This is after consulting with the AT&T website and confirming that I had the correct APN settings entered.I tried the default Sony messaging app, Google Messenger, Google Hangouts, Textra, and other SMS/MMS apps, with no success.I have thrown in the towel on this phone, especially after the manufacturer refused to honor the 1-year warranty (as advertised in the product description). **August 2016 update** just loaded CM13 which is android 6 Marshmallow! This phone is still going strong!**May 2016 Update** Just unlocked the bootloader on this phone and installed Cyanogen 12. Wow, what an improvement!! Very happy after owing this phone for almost two years.**update 2015** I\\'ve had this phone for almost a year and just loaded the new lollipop os and it is awesome! A year later and I still love my phone, the battery life, and more importantly the price. You can\\'t beat an unlocked phone fit the size and price running Android Lollipop.This phone has been great and deserves more publicity. I am giving this review as a long time iPhone user and gave up my iPhone 5 for this phone. I tried crossing over to the dark side before, but 4 different crappy Android phones in a year drove me back to IOS. This was before the Samsung Galaxy phones which I have watched for the past few years. Android seems much more polished now and I have no complaints about the operating system.This phone is HUGE! It is snappy and has handled everything I have thrown at it. I tried to be realistic upon its arrival and not compare this $300 never heard of company before to the same level of a $650 Samsung Galaxy phone, but I believe it holds its on. This is just as good as flagship phone and could be one. The battery life is good. After 20 hours of HEAVY use, I was at 20% battery. That is pretty good for this screen size. It has 4G LTE, 2GB of RAM, and a phone manager cleanup program. If you toss a Trident Cyclops case on this thing (leave the screen protector on) you will have a nice feeling, sturdy Phablet that you will get attention and questions about when you whip it out! So why the 4 star rating? #1 There is not a working Amazon app for this phone. That\\'s a biggie since obviously I shop Amazon. It let me install it once, but that made my phone crash and keeping rebooting until I did a factory restore. Good thing I had issues with my Android experience back in the day and made a backup to restore. #2 The phone volume is very very low when making a call. #3 No 4.4 kit Kat. While all these things are not deal breakers, they do make this a 4 star instead of 5 star phone. works perfectly no issues I bought this phone as \"NEW\" ... Was not a new phone ... If you want this phone buy it from another seller ... When I opened the box the phone was in a Sony Ericson box for a flip phone .. I love this phone and expected a NEW (not used or refurbished one) phone ...Now to the problem:#1 I love the phone but the problem is when I use it everything works except when on the internet .. It will connect and stay online for 10 seconds to a minute (longer it you don\\'t try to navigate past the Home screen of the page your looking at) then the phone powers down and back up without warning ...#2 The screen blacks out if the outside temp. is over 75 degrees and without warning and to reset that you have to remove the battery for a secondOverall the phone was CRAP unless that\\'s all you wanted it for was to place a call (like a home phone or cell from the 80\\'s) SO I can not stress the FACT anymore .. Buy it from someone not selling you JUNK like these guys I received my phone on time and it\\'s working perfect What an upgrade compared to the iPhone 4. Going to love this phone. Glad I got a case for it already and everything. So far so great! I was a little hesitate buying a refurbished phone, but I have had zero issues! It runs great, hardly any scratches or scuffs and the 64GB of storage is amazing compared to the 8GB of storage I had on my iPhone 4S. Really glad I found this awesome deal on Black Friday! Nice case to protect phone I m starting the headline with that because, they contact me and solve one of my problems. I bought this phone for a birthday present, I bought it on July 9th and the gift was suppose to be opened on 13/09/13. Well, She opened the gift, put the battery at the back of the phone, and guess what? It didn\\'t turn on! So, I put the charger on the phone, for about 4 hours to turn it on and guess what again? It didn\\'t turn on.The thing is that I\\'m in Venezuela and it will cost me like 40 Bucks to send it back to U.S., and I can\\'t afford to do that ( 40 Bucks are 1.600 Bs. wich is half of the minimun wedge), They refund my money, but the deception does not have a price. Smaller than the picture Love the price. Love the phone. So light. Big screen. I might exchange it though because it has been randomly shutting down on its own and the charger squeals when plugged in. I love the phone though so I\\'d definitely want the same one again despite those glitches. I like this product. Thank you Great phone! Am really happy with the Samsung note 4. The phone met my expection absolutely, as was described by the seller. I can\\'t complain much about it. It does what it\\'s meant to do and I\\'m happy with my purchase. Muchos problemas al escribir This cell phone is very bad. Se reinicia solo. The memory is bad. I don\\'t know what happened with the phone. I don\\'t like. Great phone at a great price. I would request using a different delivery carrier other than USP. I recently bought this phone from Amazon a d found out it is. Not unlocked as advertised and spent an hour on the phone (landline) unlocking it. The phone is great otherwise, but had to uninstall all ATT apps, what a pain, do not know if I would buy another phone from Amazon. Buyer Beware. The phone arrived a couple of days before it was due, a good effort as this was an international delivery. A small problem with the manual was very quickly sorted by their service desk. The phone worked well out of the box and provides everything I need I bought this at very affordable price compared to the Apple Store. The watch worked like brand new Great phone Excellent cell phone It works great! Muy bueno el producto todo salio bien saludos desde venezuela feliz navidad muchas gracias lo empacaron muy bien feliz año nuevo 2012 6 stars!!!!! Very Good! I am very happy with the S4 mini. The phone is light weight and the display is really bright. All the apps run just as fast as on the S4 and the battery life will last the whole day. good Great phone at a great price! The AXON is amazing. The very first thing that I noticed was that it ran super smooth and fast. The LTE speeds are amazing. The very first speed test that I did gave me a download speed of 31.97Mbps on AT&T...Super Impressive regardless of what I am doing on the device. This ZTE AXON is a beautiful phone has great cameras. The pictures are clean and crisp in the auto setting. The Modes settings allows you take choose a ton of options that it make you look like a pro with every shot. Love the dedicated camera button. My other favorite feature is the impressive battery life, it last me all day even on super heavy usage days. Don\\'t spend $600, $700, $800 or even more when you can get it call with this phone!!! the camera is not 8 mp Great cellphone love it This is a back up phone, for that is pretty good, if you need a primary phone go high up in price. everything is fine thanks The flashlight worked. Nothing else worked - It said it would work with my PureTalk SIM.. but it does not. - - So I got the battery in my iPhone 3G replaced, and am back to using that one. So, I have a 65-dollar Brick. It had scuffs on the sides of the phone but works great bellisimo Surprisingly nice phone. First of all it\\'s huge but that\\'s what I wanted. But it\\'s very well built not cheap at all. It connected to T-Mobile LTE no problems I didn\\'t have to adjust APN settings. Display is bright and very nice, not galaxy amoled bright but a nice screen anyway. The skin isn\\'t too over bearing it\\'s pleasant and easy to work with. Of course battery lasts well over a day, I had 45% leftover by bedtime. I was happy the phone came with its own screen protector and case. I wish it used microsd card but 32GB internal was ok. Overall an excellent phone hopefully posh will come out with some competition for these $800-$1000 phones on the market. Instructions not clear hard to set. Never got it set. Returned it. great phone, easy to use, great camera returned it Great phone. So far so good, It is bit larger than I expected, but that\\'s my fault, not the phone\\'s. It has an incredible stand by battery life, I went to bed with 78% battery and after 7 hs, batter was 77%, once the massive screen is in use, well, it consumes the regular battery for that size. But it is good to know that the battery won\\'t simply disappear if you leave your phone for a few hours. Great speed, great photos. I was able to upgrade to 5.0 lollipop.Mine came as T Mobile braded but when I put my Argentinian sim card it worked perfectly, so it was unlocked, just not factory unlocked. VERY GOOD excellent Best phone for its price. No other phone in the same price range comes close to what you get from 920. Great cellphone at a cheap price good Bought two of them and my husband had no problem with his but mine had all kinds of bugs and since I threw away all my info I ended up throwing the phone awaytoo because Verizon could not help me with it either It didn\\'t meet my expectation because it had no sim slot available. Nice phone, a bit more complicated than my Samsung S3 mini it replaces.The big negative is it advertised as new but in fact it was not. Originally sold by Angel Cellular and activated in April 2014 by AT&T, confirmed by AT&T. very fast Good Awesome was not a new phone, did not work, was a waste of my time sent it back and bought phone straight from apple. The iPhone came in a very good condition, I would say almost mint. The iPhone 6 Plus is a nice big phone that my wife just love. It\\'s easier for her to type and also works as a very nice ebook reader where now she can see more since the screen is bigger. ok I have been using this phone for a while now. Great phone and strong battery life. Camera is great for daily, casual use.Its a powerful smartphone for a fair price. Garbage The best phone ever. I received very defective device. it stoped chargeing only first 2 weeks. first It would show its charging bUT after 8 hours of charge it would have charged only 5%. And then i did stop charging at all I had email the vendor and they replied after 2 days and then i took them another two more days to give me an email to return the device it will be a return So far so amazing , phones a great buy.. A lot of people are complaining about the screen and speaker ... Screen is great and speaker is actually louder than I thought Hello, everybody. I have bought this htc and it says that it was UNLOCKED, BUT ITS NOT UNLOCKED. What I have to do to unlock the phone??? please answer me, im not happy with the bought :/ Im from Brazil. Thank you the headphone does not work. served the purpose I ordered this phone in May and it died in July. Won\\'t turn on and won\\'t charge. After some googling I came to the conclusion that it has to be replaced somehow. LG phones come with one year warranty automatically so I contacted LG US, and was told there\\'s nothing they can do because they don\\'t have all the parts. Then I contacted LG UK and they said they are only able to pick up service requests from UK, even if I spend the $20 to ship it there, they won\\'t be able to ship it back. From my research, this issue is not that uncommon but most customers with this issue are protected with the warranty since it mostly happened within 2 to 6 months, after the Amazon return period.Therefore if you live somewhere other than UK, please understand the risk before buying. Also it doesn\\'t get 4G in US, the top review is for the Korean version and this is the UK one.This has been a very expensive lesson for me, please don\\'t make the same mistake. muy bien The phone works great, arrived in good condition. However, the Spen that came with it was defective. really awesome cellphone for the price! Regular I don\\'t want to write down a full summary of this phone with pros and cons. Everyone one has personal opinions and tastes on cell phones, I can just guarantee something, once you have this cell phone in your hand, you won\\'t go back. And the phone does what a high-tech phone is almost obliged to do, there might be a few features that you would like to have like wireless charging, perhaps a better camera (4 ultra pixel is okay, but again, just okay), but in the end, is a piece of art, impressed with the battery life.If you want to have the ONE Android cell phone in the market, don\\'t hesitate and get this cell phone. Kuddos to HTC, they did make it better. received phone in 2days, was very excited. opened box, put in A T & T sims card. volume good with calls.........but cannot download any apps from play store, always saying time out. works very slow. Thinking about returning phone : ( no fun if can\\'t download music and games. Bah Humbug !!!!!!! Sadly my loves phone has been dropped and stepped on, so the screen is so super cracked that he can hardly see through it anymore. Fortunately BLU phones are the most inexpensive (unlocked) smartphones I have found so I decided to purchase a new one to replace it...found that there is a new version (BLU Advance 5.0) for like $10 cheaper so I picked that one up instead (will review when it arrives) Great phone?!!!!! It didn t say That it couldn t be use in spanish.it is an internacional versión but it doesn t Work in spanish. it is a good product. But the screen is not clear. it is very important to me. i bought it for my mother so...it is okay. Not a good experience at all. Took a while to come in mail. Then when I received it. None of the functions worked besides it connecting to phone. I downloaded various bt programs and it still did not work. Not a good purchase at all. You all remember the StarTek; back in the late 90s it was THE flip phone. Since then no flip phone has ever been the same; I can\\'t flip any of them with one hand with a flicking motion without thinking they\\'ll fly against the wall.Since then, I have only gotten bar phones. This one is the best I\\'ve used, of any type of phone. Firstly, I love how Sony Ericcson\\'s handle phonebooks; I don\\'t know why but I like it. When Motorolas read my sim card they screw it up and don\\'t read each contact\\'s numbers as a group, they give each number an individual entry. I also think SEs have the sexiest fonts and graphics.The thing I like best about this phone is definately the fact that I can hook it up to my computer (it comes with a usb cable, separate from the charging cable, and a 50some MB memory card for starters; it can hold a lot though obviously it\\'s not a portable hard drive but you can buy up to 2 GB so far, higher when you can buy the recently announced 4 GB card) and transfer images, videos, mp3s, and other files to/from the phone. That means I can make custom backgrounds, ringtones, alerts (video, image, or audial) on my computer and then put them on my phone without being charged for sending over the cell networks. Also, it has bluetooth and infrared, though I don\\'t have any other devices that use these communication protocols.The real highlight of the phone, besides the fact that it doesn\\'t drop calls ever, is the camera. 3 Megapixels is about the best you can get without buying from Asia and the quality is great. It\\'s true, at night in large spaces where the light can\\'t reflect back, some residuals show up as artifacts (discolorations) but not enough to detract from all the rest of the features. I feel like my phone\\'s camera has more features than a real digital camera costing $600+. I\\'m gonna turn it on and try to cover them all:There is a \\'frame\\' feature which puts preset cartoony drawings on the screen and then you take a picture that will show up behind it (like an astronaut suit.... so any picture you take will have an astronaut suit overlayed on top of it; it\\'s a good gimmick for kids). There is a panoramic feature: you take 3 pictures from left to right and the camera will merge them for you. There is a feature called \\'best pic\\' which is for drunk or motion pictures: the camera takes 9 pictures very quickly and you can check through all of them to see which ones you want to save. There are also tons of lighting, stability, and other options that I don\\'t use because I trust the automatic settings (they have worked great so far). My favorite options are the effects: color, black and white, negative, orangey (like old-fashioned photos), and overexposed (like a painting). You can take videos in any one of these modes. The video of my girlfriend dancing naked around a pole with black stalkings and heels is the best video i\\'ve ever seen; it was taken in negative mode and her stalkings are white, her skin is blue, her hair is white, and so is her private area... it looks like the gates of heaven.After you take photos/videos, you can also edit them. You can zoom in/out and resave the picture, rotate it, add even more effects, overlay text, combine effects, you can trim videos. The only downside is, when I converted movie files from my computer to 3gp format and put them on my phone, I couldn\\'t edit them in the on-phone video editor because they were too long. I can do that on my computer though; I was just too impatient.Also, the screen is large and quality; my friend asked me if this is high def. and I regularly jerk it to porn that I\\'m viewing on the phone. There is plenty of free software available from sony that you can download to the phone (some of which allows you to change the colors of menus, fonts, etc). Other features I like: mp3 player, fm radio player, tons of accessories you can buy. I have owned the phone for a month and a half, have been playing with it constantly, and I am still finding new features.People also like my phone; when I tell them it is so new that Cingular didn\\'t know it existed when I called to verify that it\\'d work on their network (it does even though they said it wouldn\\'t) and that the only place that sells it is amazon.com, I wonder if they are impressed. I think they are; I am.It sucks to have to pay $370 for a new phone but, screw it, when they release an even cooler phone that Cingular knows about, I will get that and sign up for the 2 year agreement.I\\'d bet that anyone who has the insight to buy this phone won\\'t be disappointed. Sorry I have delivered today, however from what little I\\'ve seen is good, I\\'ve put my chips on the other phone and has responded well can well say that is functional Well for starters it keeps saying that the SD card has suddenly been removed then I shake it and it says preparing SD card. There\\'s no on and off for the shutter sound on the camera and a couple other tech. glitched. Not satisfied at all GOOD Works very well, and looks as promised. Loving my new phone! This is my international phone. it works great.. I like it, shipping early and nice phone. Thanks Works good ,, as the product was as it was described. Works great . I do not have ATT but straight talk and its does not make no difference compared to ATT No issues...reached on time and was exactly what was posted. Mi good like gold.....Love it This phone died fast everyday how bad it only works with t mobile 4g \\'\\'lte The phone was brand new and worked perfectly. Great picture quality , lots of space to download apps. Absolutely great deal on the phone. Have no issues so far would recommend this phone to my friends and family. amazon you rock. I liked the OCTANE LG so much that when I lost it and got it stolen there was no other cell phone I could replace it with in terms of high quality. I received the OCTANE LG many days sooner than promised, and it only took me 10 seconds to activate it. The speaker is very clear and loud. The keyboard is large, sturdy and thick ( not found with other keyboard cells ). It takes good pictures and great 30 sec. videos with clear sounds, plus the battery lasts super long. I dont need internet on my phone, and this phone is the best! Until the moment the team result satisfactory to me, very good. Is compliantwith my expectations, as indicated in its manufacture is very good. This smart watch by Jersa is a nice little watch. Although I was not actually able to go online with this phone because I was having technical issues not allowing me to access full use of this cool watch, I did contact the company and they was more than helpful and willing to assist me in fixing the issues. It is easy to get into to put your card in and comes with a instruction pamphlet. It has a nice durable band that adjusts for different size wrists. Easy to turn on and off and slides from side to side to access the windows. Great company to work with. The phone is great and came quickly, however, the earphones didnt come with the phone. It was clear that someone took them out. Perfect for the defender case. It fits snugly and stays secure. Delivered in two days. Im working off AT&T, and it says that its suppose to be fully compatible with 4gLTE but, its not. I like the phone, but this problem is making want to purchase a different phone that really does give you 4g LTE networks this product presents many problems, constantly restarts and the screen turns on and off constantly, when receiving a call or message the computer shuts down, you update the software and the problem still persists, appreciate your help with this problem good I bought this new phone.But never work, only showed the home screen for hours No Problems Phone was advertised as unlocked but came locked to Verizon. Had to call and get that taken care of before it could be used. Outstanding product. Does everything I need. I couldn\\'t see spending twice the price to get an apple product. No contract and unlocked is the only way to fly. Phone feels solid, not like a piece of plastic. Email and web browsing are a snap. Calendar is useful. Just as described, delivered on time, works perfect! Camera needs to be a little more better!!! excente good product met all my expectations good phone Todo ok Ok condition Works good! Fast delivery! Had no problems hooking it up with Verizon. thank you for the price it is a decent phone. specs, waterproof, weight, and size. The camera however for the high pixels wasn\\'t that great and the phone couldn\\'t record any videos, all we get was a black screen with audio only. After a google search we weren\\'t the only ones experiencing this problem. Haven\\'t experience overheating but do get random power off where only a hard reset will solve it, not reliable if it shut off and you\\'re expecting calls or alarms. The seller and shipping was great, not so much the phone. I say pass and get something more reliable and less bloatware. I am buying these for the two landlines I transferred to T-mobile. I have a personal cell spot so reception is superb in my house. However, the phone seemed to drop connection when not being used. When I click on call button to turn on the screen, I often see the connections of both lines in emergency or unavailable status. But then will connect to TMO after a a few seconds. The call quality is spotty at best. When I take the phone to a Starbucks next door, the phone lost cell signals.So, the phone is kind of in working condition in my house and seemed to be useless when traveling. I am giving it 3 stars since it works sometimes in my house and does what I need for now. The radio and flashlights are also good features if I don\\'t use it as a phone long term. Awesome phone!. It\\'s just amazing :) Broke before I even got it on my child\\'s arm. Cheap made in China junk. A+ My husband purchased it. HIs comments are: OK so everyone is entitled to one mistake. This was mine. Should have read the reviews more closely. The wrist strap is way to small. The instruction manual is less than useless. Can\\'t get the ring tone volume to increase. Unless you are tech savvy I would not buy it. Gave it one extra star because the mp3 player worked. ( Had to buy Bluetooth head phones and keep the watch in my pocket.) Android Smart Phone works great and got it at a great price. Well satisfied. I am so disappointed! I bought one of these phones and used it for over 2 years and loved it. When i finally bought an iPhone, I told my husband this phone was great. However, when we got this phone. It was in good shape. It looked new but the cord that came with it was messed up? When we tried to charge the phone it said this cord is not recommended for this phone. So we have been trying to make it work. But. Ow the phone won\\'t even hold a charge! And now it\\'s too late to return it! Very disappointed!!! Very good cel I had a Samsung exhibit for a few years. My son uses the Samsung Galaxy and just got the 6. He will pay over $700 over the next 2 years for it. I just can\\'t see me paying that much when the Blu works just as well for only $120. Heck for $700 I can get the best tablet or a really good laptop. As describe by other reviewers it performs as they say it does. Very responsive, good battery life and it does everything that I need it to do. Great phone for the price. It comes with a S4 charger... Excelente good I really like this phone. The screen is beautiful! The rear camera is excellent! The whole thing is very zippy.The downside is that average real use is only about 14-18 hours on a full charge. You MUST plug it in every night or it will be dead in the morning. If you had a particularly full day of cellular data use, I think the above numbers would be halved down to 7-9 hours. Work perfect in Venezuela Very good condition Very high configuration for the price. Nice to have this phone lo mejor que pude comprar Great Sucked. Didn\\'t work. Came earlier than I expected! Great device. Good product I like the phone very much for the price. only the battery life is not as great. Wondering where can I get a Replacement battery as well. vivo en Venezuela, el equipo funciona perfecto,buen modelo de BB lo recomiendo, tiene buena camara, es super liviano, de verdad lo recomiendo. El unico detalle es que el telefono no tiene garantia y no trae tarjeta de memoria, pero se le puede comprar una y son bien economicas! Exelent DO NOT I REPEAT DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT THIS IS THE 2ND PHONE I GOT AND ITS A PAPER WEIGHT THE WIFI DON\\'T WORK LOSES RANGE AS A CUSTOMER PLEASE DO NOT BUY THIS ITEM No memory space in the phone The phone has exceeded all my expectations. I have no regrets I bought this phone a few months back. After rooting and tweaking the phone a bit it hums along nicely.The biggest plus of this phone is performance to price. I looked long and hard before I made my purchase, and I don\\'t think you will find a better android phone under $200.The biggest drawback this phone has is all the bloatware installed on it. To make it trickier, the phone must be rooted to remove most of it. Phone did not work properly. The store I used was quick to fix. All in all I am still a satisfied customer. Phone freezes Ordered what I thought was a new phone. The packaging looked old and the item wasn\\'t packaged neatly. The plastic covering the sensors and lenses were crooked and there were traces of dust and wear. Also, it says D850 on several places inside the phone despite it being a D851. I\\'m not sure if that\\'s normal. The phone is black but the charger is white and appears dirty. Doesn\\'t feel right for a new phone.I\\'m returning this phone to seller DPS Banners. The proximity sensor doesn\\'t work which prevent s the display from turning on during a call. To make things worse there is no way to disable this \"feature\" without rooting. Stay away from this phone.I purchased this phone less than a year ago. From the beginning the phone was a little slow to respond in many ways but I could deal with it. About 3 months ago the camera stopped working entirely. I called customer support and was told to do a soft reset, then hard reset. Neither of those worked.I asked about sending the phone in for repair and was informed that because this model came from Hong Kong, that they could not repair it, it is not covered under warranty, I would have to contact the Hong Kong customer service. I have been back and forth between both Hong Kong and US customer service, both of them just give me the run around and refuse to take responsibility for their faulty product, and will not repair it. After contacting the US customer service again, they advised me to do a software repair. I followed the steps and now my phone is entirely stuck on the beginning intro screen and will not function at all. In other words, right now I paid over $500.00 for a non functioning phone with Sony refusing to fix their faulty product.This phone is a giant lemon, and after dealing with Sonys customer service I will never purchase a Sony product again. Excelente Ok, but didn\\'t know cannot access battery for replacement if it ever died in the future Over all the phone is good, but did not come with a battery as stated in the profile. Some small scratches, not too bad. Really good product, the phone works great. Works really fine with the operators in Colombia. If you can, you must have this phone. has good features but the quality is not there. I love the phone! It came quickly and was unlocked and the model I ordered, and my changing carriers worked fine. Many great features on phone and beautiful display. A great improvement over my iPhone 4 in so many ways el bb 9780 llego en perfectas condiciones, nuevo, con su pila, cargador y demas originales, la memoria de 2gb..,lo unico que la banda 3G es solo 1,2,4 ( es decir Digitel )... Excellent I was blown away with the quality and performance of this phone. I\\'m used to higher end smartphones so I wasn\\'t expecting much from a sub $100 phone but this Moto E has features that you only find on phones of twice or even three times this price point. It\\'s amazing Motorola was able to pack so many feature at this price point and keep the quality of the phone still quite high.Has Bluetooth LE so it works great with my Smartwatch, extra MicroSD card for storing music and apps, Android 4.4 and the battery life is amazing! I can easily get two days of use with just one charge. I bought the US GSM version to use on T-Mobile and I\\'ve been getting HSDPA speeds without any kind of issue both in California and Florida.Overall I\\'m extremely happy with this phone and I keep it as my little Back-up/Travel phone. RECOMMENDED VERY GOOD PHONE 100% Great phone! Battery gets low very quick and even worst when you play games and takes an eternity to fully charge and the phone gets hot. Other than that its good and excellent 👌 camera Had to get camera fixed when it come in. Phone works good. Won\\'t buy another from them. Arrived on time! Has a few scratches but it works and I\\'m happy about this product ok.. gracias Excellent phone! I am using it as a tablet (no phone service) and it\\'s much better than tablets, unless you need a larger tablet to double as a laptop. The size is perfect for my stocky hands, and at less than 5 ounces, it beats even a small tablet, like Fire HD 6, which weighs over 10 ounces. The screen size is the same as iPhone 6 Plus, and for a good reason. Anything bigger than this would be awkward to carry around. The sim card from my defunct tracfone (LG840G, which is not even an Android phone) works in my POSH. It just sees it as a new sim. Of course, if you want to have a cellphone service, you will have to purchase a sim from a service provider (AT&T, T-Mobile, Straight Talk, etc). The screen resolution (1280x720) is quite adequate for all practical purposes; it comes out to about 267 ppi. So far (after a couple of weeks of usage) I would highly recommend this phone, if you want an Android phone (or a small tablet). Note: if you intend to use it only as a tablet, then turn on the airplane mode, so it won\\'t be constantly searching for a cell signal, as it will drain battery. Then turn the WiFi on (in this order). When I received the watch a month I no longer returned to work well, Bataria not charged, the headset will not work at this time are useless DON\\'T BUY THIS PHONE!Big buttons! Great! But the navigation ring around the enter button was a nightmare to use. It kept turning on the radio and good luck with turning the damn thing off. The task bar was ridiculous for a senior to try to use. The icons are framed with a tiny,tiny little blue outline which is impossible to see unless you are looking at it though a magnifying glass. Also, there are two slots for sim cards. If you only fill one, the \"insert sim card\" wording still stays on the screen which is a distraction. Sound quality was good but the navigation around this phone is bad thing that just kills what could have been a great little phone. In addition, tell me what good big buttons on the phone is good for when the instructions (what there are of them) are printed in size 4 font. What Senior citizen could read them? Worst phone I have ever bought and I am returning it immediately. I got a white phone, while I ordered black. The speaker in the phone is very weak and hard to hear. Excelente Phone was great and met all expectations.At the begining I thought I can\\'t connect to the cellular network with a new sim. Requested for support through email, this was a little slow and not helpfull.Eventually found out (myself) I just had to restart the device after inserting the sim. Would not work right with StraightTalk but the phone itself is great ! Phone was worse than expected with dents on back and damage to all corners. So far screen is flawless and phone stays charged, works well. This product is excellent\\'m very really exceeded my expectations thank you very much. I hope to keep getting your offers of other products. I can\\'t get the thing to sync with my phone. I even watched several Youtube videos on how to do it and still can\\'t figure it out. Can\\'t find the sound to turn it down or off. Can\\'t pull up the apps section most of the time. Sending it back. Don\\'t waste your money! Phone works fine The home button doesn\\'t work every few times, said it was like new which it is besides that. A little disappointed I am very satisfied with my phone great phone, great battery life, Super light but does not included all ATT LTE bands. This is basic, but has all the features necessary for seniors. I use it when I travel abroad and use a local sim card. Dual card is a little confusing and I don\\'t have a handle on it yet. Maybe on my next trip. this is a replacement for one that I broke. It is as expected a functional unit I bought this as a gift. My husband has had nothing but problems with this phone. He took it to a T-mobile store and was told it is not compatible with their network. I bought it because the description says it works on GSM carriers like ATT and T-mobile. So That is obviously deceptive. Verizon does not recognize the phone. it cannot be activated. I received the phone and it was clearly locked to Verizon. Waste of money with the title clearly stating it is unlocked. Very nice Its working just fine i rate it a 5 star.... My daughter is very happy and Pleased with it.... GOOD! Works as supposed Definitely great for its price, especially since it\\'s an unlocked phone. Never heard of FIGO but thought I\\'d try it out.Speed - the biggest downside. A bit slow when booting up, starting up apps, and navigating throughout.Battery life - only like 8-10 hours before I have to charge again.Mobile tethering - thank god this phone can tether and do hot spots no problem. My previous HTC One M7 couldn\\'t do it without rooting.Resolution - pretty decent interface, takes decent photos/videos overall.Data - automatically turns off when I\\'m using WiFi so I can\\'t receive MMS while on WiFi.Phone case - it\\'s flimsy so I don\\'t imagine much protection if I drop the phone. It is nice protection from the rain, and you can use it as a stand while watching Netflix which is a plus.If you\\'re on a budget and want a solid, unlocked smartphone, this is a must buy. Issues with this that remain unresolved. My 1st review was removed. Let\\'s see if this one stays. NOT happy!! I would NOT recommend!! so far only complaint is difficulty figuring out how to get nano sim card in it...and a bit of att junk software. you can root the phone but there\\'s not root control software for this version yet. Yes, it does, the 128mb ram arent enough. The phone would be perfect if the people at nokia included 256mb ram. It is very slow and wo graphics accelerator so no fancy games or apps. Other than that it would make a DREAM PHONE. Too bad.OHHH and BTW, theres software included that you CANNOT DELETE, and the office part of the phone SUCKS too, you CANNOT EDIT office files, only view and the pdf reader is a 30 day trial. For that kind of money... Its a nice cellphone Love this phone. My son in law recommended it, I am so glad he did. My mom loves it. Excellent phone, completely tackles everything I throw at it. Phone calls are great and clear, texting is sharp and crisp, the camera is amazing!Pros:Phone Call QualityEase of UsePerformanceCamera QualityWaterproofCons:Slippery in the handNon-removable battery Very clean product two thumbs up. Arrived early, met all expectations Great phone. Came before was expected Good pictures 4week very nice. 好看不卡 No doubt Made in USA. Actually the Xiaomi of USA. But we have a new problem. Starting this year Blu. have decide to add their own UI on top of android. This UI is immature ,useless ,bloatware and. Unrootable. I will never use another blu product as long as this bloatware is present. I know UI leads to control which leads to an ecosystem which leads to Blu pay which leads to Wall street listing worth a billion. but this is not the time blu. we have long way to go. at least give us option to remove this bloat ware. Very nice phone I thought is was new ...but it wasn\\'t ...... some times it will work and sometimes it won\\'t.. Phone was not new as listed on Amazon. Phone was blacklisted so it couldn\\'t be used. I was very disappointed with this purchase. camara y flash deficiente has software problems Very good product for the price, particularly when you see the price new. Delivery was slower than advertised. Speaker whiskey poor, bought a different BLU model and big difference! Perfect fit, husband is able to find the phone easily with the yellow accent color At first I really liked this phone. About 4 months into use the battery stopped charging. I had to send in the phone for a replacement.It took 2 1/2 weeks for return of my repaired phone. Shortly after the gps stopped working properly and the gorilla glass shattered on a very low drop. I am hoping somebody from Posh Mobile or Amazon will read this review and make things right. Not real happy with my Posh Mobile experience! Nice watch, worked nicely and had a nice camera... Will buy again It\\'s been used on gsm network in Africa. Memory want 1GB Device arrived in 2 days...in Excellent Condition!!!! clean, transferred w/no issues...updated already...accepted my 16G mem card...I might be be kinda happy....just might be...... the best Not a huge fan of the operating system but the phone itself is awesome! I buy the galaxy s4 here in usa for my girlfriend .. and when my girlfriend went to Venezuela after two months ruined. when connected to charge after a few hours not charge anything. I\\'m upset because I paid nearly $ 600 dollars and for two months was ruined. I feel sorry for my girlfriend who was his first galaxy s4. disappointed with this seller \"Acceptable\" but the condition was actually impeccable. 👍🏽 This watch is great! I no longer need to carry my phone while exercising and it sends me reminders to get up and move if I have been idle too long. Best part is the ping to breathe, and tells me my heart rate after - I haven\\'t taken it off since I bought it! The watch is connected and off all the time I bought this handset for a friend after reading on the web a lot about how good is the device for an Android starter user. What can I say... My buddy is REALLY happy with it so I have no complains.. Over a year later and still very happy with this product! Because it don\\'t work with Verizon Company. This is a great stand espicially for the price range it is in. Very nice wood and seamlessly put together. It has an attached power cord along with three spaces on the back for plugging in charges cords. It has a great space for your iPhone and an extra slot for another device as well. Overall this is a very nice piece. Great phone...used it as a gift! The phone is great. The dealer I bought from not so great. When I bought this phone for my daughter for her birthday recently, she was very excited with all it\\'s features. However, the charging cord for the HDMI dock was damamged upon arrival, and when I complained to BREED, he first sent the wrong charger cord, then when I contacted BREED about the incorrect charger, he then claimed he never sold me the dock to start with. My only option was to return the phone, insured, and wait several weks for reimbursement. As the replacement charger was less than $10, I chose to replace the cord myself, rather than deal with all the hassle, as I\\'m sure BREED was counting on. DO NOT BUY FROM dealer BREED. this phone have bad quality the sound barley works the screen blanked out after the first day of having it I do not recommend anyone to order this phone. ordered it and it came on time, nothing wrong with the phone. it only cost $15 for a sim card to activate your phone or switch phones (same carrier). truly decent.((my carrier is t-mobile)) Owned this phone for over 6 months and it has been generally GREAT!Well worth the price.However, 8GB internal storage memory is not enough for me otherwise an excellent phone - -processing speed is great.Wish the 64GB memory card could allow freeing up more space on the internal 8GB.Even though I store everything possible to SD card - always have insufficient internal storage to download new apps.Camera is just Okay not amazing in low lightBattery life is AWESOME and this is where this phone shines the best - full day and still 30-40% battery remaining... Best inexpensive phone ever, it beats iphone 6 at many tests OK watch. Early and novel concept. Lack of storage for apps about 250megs makes it about useless. Very satisfied with the product and the services I love it great product A + + + + + + + + + + + + ++ + I not satisfied with this phone not working properly I love this iPhone! The color is distinctive and it\\'s easy to use. Everything I need right at my fingertips. Over the weekend I shows this to a bunch of relatives. Even set it next to a relative\\'s Samsung S6 and it looks just as nice. Battery life is incredible.In a world where the latest iPhone is $1000 and the latest flagship Samsung device is 1/2 to 3/4 of that price you really have to wonder how bad a $110 phone is. Supridingly, this is an excellent phone. It may not be the best at any one thing but really aren\\'t any glaring deficiencies. The screen is big, high resolution IPS and bright. The phone is responsive and the relatively stock Android Operating system is easy to use and customize. The battery life is excellent. Blu tosses in a cover and screen protector for free. This phone is kind of a no-brainer for those who don\\'t want to invest a lot of cash or if they have kids who abuse phones. You can even run dual SIMs and expand the storage memory. It has a nice solid fell and looks and fells like a much more expensive phone. I like it a lot![+] Notable Feature: Dual SIM slots[+] Display: 5\" IPS HD, 720x1280,Gorilla Glass 3 (scratch resistant)[+] OS: Android 5 Lollipop[+] Network: ATT/Tmobile HSPA+[+] CPU: 1.3 Ghz Quad Core[+] Camera: 8MP Sony Front, 5MP Back[+] Mem ory: 1GB RAM[+] Storage: 8GB Storage and up to an additional 64GB with Micro SD Slot[+] Battery: 2800 mAh Battery for 72 hours usage[+] Connectivity: USB 2.0, Bluetooth 4.0, Wi-Fi B/GN[+] Comes with: Headset, protective case, screen protector, charging cable, wall plug and instructions. My phone just died after 6 months. Will not charge. Be very careful this company has terrible customer service. :) Great watch for the price bluetooth app isn\\'t very good but i put my sim card in and it worked great! Also i havent figured out how to use the browser yet each time i load google.com it says connection failed. Not good at all Well it\\'s working but not I expected!! It does some weird features like it got zoom out when I\\'m texting and sometimes got kinda frozen too... Mmmmmm kinda disappointed!! PROS:Battery life was excellent. 3 Weeks with active use.Simple to use and easy to navigate.Seems to be very strong and doesn\\'t mind being dropped unlike a smartphone.CONS:No T9 for text messaging, No predictive dictionary .Kinda bummed me out but it\\'s not a deal breaker.Nothing else has really come up. great phone for the price. wish the battery lasted longer. had to download the APN settings for my carrier from youtube for 4G lte and it was easy. Good phone was unlocked and worked with other country sims.ConNo head phones jack It is a good cell phone, if you want a phone that meets the basic functions.the downside is that the camera shutter is slow and you have to keep the pose long. works good but keep cutting out ,keep turning it back on , will return number are small and a bit bulky I like it For what you are paying, this phone is absolutely fantastic. The only problem that I have had with it is the storage on the phone itself, but there is the option to add more storage. It is definitely worth the money. The screen is clear and big enough so you don\\'t have to strain to see anything, yet it isn\\'t so big that it is cumbersome. Good product Great phone was bummed out to find out after hooking it up I could have got a note 4 for $75 More then what I paid for this and Amazon wanted $175 More It does not protect my whole phone TL;DR PRO/CON list at bottom.I will start off this review by saying that I really wanted to love this phone. It does have some very good qualities about it. But the phone has its faults, which are enough for me to not give this phone a recommendation. I have used the phone for approximately 6 months.By background is that I worked in the cell phone industry selling phones for years, before moving into corporate IT and networking. I have been a amateur phone enthusiast and have easily had over 30 phones in my day. I also take exceptional care of my belongings, electronics getting special care. Seeing as this phone is a bit expensive for the size, it was a bit of a treat for myself as the specs and design looked like everything I wanted.HardwareScreen is a nice size for one handed use. Is very crisp and easy to see inside and outside in bright sunlight. Physical buttons are a tad awkward being so low on the device, but worked well for how I hold a phone. They provide enough click, but are a little hard to \"feel out\" and press during a call. Volume on the dual speakers is adequate for a small phone and produce decent sound. Sound through earphones is very good. 2 GB of RAM is more than enough to power the 720p screen and the 810 processor never lets up. The fingerprint scanner is top notch. Works very fast and recognizes fingers well. It allows 5 fingers to be registered. I did my wife\\'s thumb, left index, right index, and my right thumb twice for better accuracy on my main digit. Sometimes I would pull the phone out of my pocket and it would already have registered my thumb and unlocked itself.UI, Performance, and Battery LifeThis phone came with Android Lollipop and is now updated to Marshmallow. The UI runs well. The fast processor and 2 GB of RAM don\\'t let this phone slow down much if at all. Sony\\'s take on Android is a very clean and minimal. Although there is plenty of Sony \"bloatware\" apps that come preinstalled and cannot be removed. You can \"disable\" them so they are no longer active and don\\'t appear in the menu, but still live on the device. The Snapdragon 810 does still tend to get hot at random times. An app may be running in the background and you can feel the phone get much warmer. Never hot that you feel in danger, but warm enough to warranty a reboot in my opinion. Once back up the device was cool again. Battery life on the phone is decent, but not close to the expectation that Sony has set with previous devices in the series. It will get you through a day easily with moderate to heavy use, and can easily stretch to two days with light use. Recharge time however is very long. If you plug into a PC to charge expect at least 3 - 4 hours to charge it up. A quick charge adapter is a wise investment if you get this phone.Apps and GamingI largely got this phone for remote play on the PS4; that feature worked wonderfully with no issues. While the small screen was a little hard to see at times, I never had an issue with pairing the PS4 controller via bluetooth or playing over WiFi. The stock messaging app always gave me trouble with MMS messages, even with the correct settings from AT&T. I constantly got a you have an MMS to download message even though I already read the message. Textra fixed that issue and is a much better messaging app in my opinion. I don\\'t really play any other types of mobile games, but companion apps for Destiny, Metal Gear Solid V, and standard apps like The Weather Channel all ran great on the device. As mentioned before there is A LOT of Sony branded items that are just flat out annoying and not needed.CameraWonderful camera. Loved to take pictures with this phone. They almost always come out clear and sharp. With the latest updates the camera opens quickly. The phone does a good job of fast auto-focus as promised. The shutter key on the side of the device is great for open the camera quickly and nice to take a picture. Finger placement while holding the phone is a bit awkward as the camera is very close the the top edge of the phone and gets covered easy if you are not careful. I spent most of my time in superior auto mode which produces 8 mp images. Going into manual will give you an overwhelming amount of options and allow full 23 mp pictures.DesignLooking at the phone it screams premium. Add waterproofing to the device and that is just piece of mind that some rain or accidental spills will not harm the device. No flap for the charge port is also wonderful as I\\'ve seen my share of them get damaged on phone such as the Galaxy S5 which kills the waterproofing of the device. The phone has a heafty weight to it that also feels good. The frosted glass back looks very nice and does not attract fingerprints. The phone is very slippery. On a scale of 1 to 10 with 1 being course grit sand paper and 10 being metal coated in Teflon covered in olive oil, this phone is a 9 easy. The phone literally wants to slide out of your hand whenever you hold it. If nothing else a case is needed to provide some grip to the phone. Having a glass front and back also made me extra cautious and nervous about potential cracks. But I have always taken care of my devices and never cracked a screen.Phone callsPhone calls on the device were clean on my end every time. There were issues for the other caller especially when I used speaker phone. Callers would often complain that they heard themselves or that they could not hear me until I went back to the earpiece. It also appeared that using the speaker phone only used the bottom speaker and not both.DurabilityThis phone is by its very nature fragile. With over 90% of the outer casing being glass, you better believe this baby is delicate. The phone came with a pre-installed screen protector, but it became cruddy very fast. I normally don\\'t use a screen protector and have never had an issue. I somehow managed to put a small scratch on the screen while it was in my pocket with NOTHING else in it one day while hiking. It was no big deal, as I couldn\\'t see it when the screen was on, but I knew it was there and worried me that it got damaged so easily. Now just recently a friend placed my phone near a counter edge, and a got a few messages in a row that made the device vibrate right off the edge. Of course it landed face down on kitchen tile. Screen completely shattered and the touch screen stopped functioning altogether. I am not knocking this phone because of my stupid mistake, not many phones if any would survive a fall like that. Instead it just goes to show that a rugged case is just about required for this device. Which is a huge bummer since the phone looks so good.TL;DR and PROS/CONS ListPROS-- Nice screen for a smaller phone-- Beautiful design-- Great camera-- Fast performance-- Sony\\'s UI has a good design-- Waterproof-- Native PS4 remote playCons-- Sony bloatware that cannot be removed, just disabled-- Slippery-- Fragile-- Poor speaker phone quality for the other caller-- Awkward button placement-- Very slow charge time-- Expensive-- Sony is slow to update UIConclusion and thoughtsThe phone is not worth the price. The camera is very nice and waterproofing is a big plus, but a few nice features do not outweigh the fact you are terrified to accidentally drop such an expensive phone. If you don\\'t let anyone else touch this phone, and put it in a really hard-core case, it may last you a good while. If you live in the real world where you may leave you phone on a desk, give it to someone to take a picture of you, or bump into something with the phone in your pocket it may be dropped and will break. Very durable. This product mates to the needs that I have, and I liked the practical and the good way its, I recommend it to general public Great phone. I recommend it. The only negative is that this phone is deceptively described as \"international\" whereas it will not work from Europe to Asia where different frequencies are used. Truly International multiple-frequency cell phones are sold and cost 2x as much.The phone description should be GT-i8190 L - the L suffix meaning Latin is because it will only be international in the Americas and maybe Japan. DO NOT buy this phone. Within two weeks of owning it the headphone jack already had a problem and the phone will not charge. When I discovered the headphone jack problem, my left earbud was not working. I tried several pairs of headphones to find that the jack was the problem. I looked up possible ways to solve the problem only to find that I would have to replace the whole lower part of the phone. Secondly, the phone began acting funky yesterday. The phone had been charging for a while and when I checked it, it only said it had been charged up to 8%. I had to turn off my phone and turn it back on to find it was at 40%. And right now it will not charge. It told me that my charger was not a supported accessory. The phone has been plugged in all night and still hasn\\'t charged. I have not tried a different charger yet, but I shouldn\\'t have to. This was a waste of money. I do not blame Apple, because I\\'ve bought from them directly before and it was wonderful, but I would not recommend buying from this seller. If you want and IPhone just save up your money and buy directly from Apple. It\\'s worth it. This j7 is as good as any S series phone.It has the best interface i have see in any phone.I have own S 3 andS4 and i rate this phone much better. My son likes his i-phone This phone is just as good as an I phone or Android glad I purchased it Realy liked this phone. Is my first smartphone. It\\'s fast, beautiful. Works fine with the network in my home. But I had a problem to use with voice calls and text. This phone don\\'t works with AT & T chip. I read this on internet:\"In China, there are three carriers: China Mobile, China Unicom and China Telecom.China Mobile: TD-SCDMA (no carrier in USA has this network)China Unicom: WCDMA (similar to ATT)China Telecom:CDMA2000 (similar to Verizon)s898t is only compatible with TD-SCDMA so I think you can only use GSM in USA with this device.\"I liked, it\\'s a perfect cell phone, except by the fact that can\\'t be used as a cell phone. I dont have a lot to say other then buy this phone. The camera quality is better than most iphones. I\\'ve compared with my friends. And it\\'s a huge difference especially in dark places. Screen is the best I\\'ve ever seen. Gaming is the best I\\'ve seen. And very fluid. I\\'ve played on notes and iphones before and the frame rate is just insane for a phone of this price. And is better and more fluid than any phone I\\'ve owned. This is also the first phone that I\\'ve never had to use a SD card on. 64 gigs and a huge battery too. BLU IS THE FUTURE!!!!Update:I have to take off two stars because the video recording quality is good but the audio is horrible. I\\'ve had phones in 2010 that would record clear high quality audio. It shouldn\\'t be that hard to put a better audio recorder or better audio format. I take good pictures with it and good videos. But the audio is just useless. I went on trips with this phone and the audio is something that really messed up the experience and memories of the footage I recorded in different countries. But all and all its a good phone for day to day use and gaming, camera but audio sucks. Took a very long time to arrive. The phone would not read the ATT card. Instructions in Chinese. Time wasted waiting. I had to return it. I have a A806 I use in Asia. One of 4 phones had excessive bloatware that could not be removed without professional help. Lenovo sellers need to be more responsible in their sales / claims. Phone works great excelente Everything is awesome, phone is great, you have everything on it, so you can\\'t be unsatisfied. It\\'s little bit heavy, but it\\' perfect is not an iphone, i bought a FAKE IPHONE. This is a fantastic phone well worth the money I don\\'t even want to open my computer any more .if you going to try to root this phone it\\'s patched so you will have a hard time to do so but the rest is great working still after a few a months of purchase This phone is fantastic. I bought used via Amazon Warehouse \"like new\" condition - wow the condition was perfect - no scratches, no dust and it works beautifully. Battery life - OMG what can I say - it is so great not to have to charge the phone a couple of times a day.I didn\\'t think I would like the iphone being and android user all these years. I glad I made the switch. The screen size is smaller than my old phone, but not by much. I had looked at the iphone6 - found that too big, the size of the 5s is just perfect Perfect!! IT GIVES YOU THE OPTIONS OF TOUCH SCREEN AND KEYBOARD, TAKES BEAUTIFUL PICTURES WITH OR WITH OUT FLASH....THIS PHONE IS FULLY EQUIPPED. Received this phone , plugged it in for an entire night, wake up the morning and tried to put it on, and it never came on. Returned it. Handy item Good seller so so phone Alot of I just wanted a phone for emergencies and texting and this phone does that. The call quality is good, texting is a bit tricky, buttons are small, small dictionary to add words to but you get used to it. Not a lot of ringtones but that\\'s fine. The camera isn\\'t great but I didn\\'t get it for that and don\\'t use it. It has a good calculator and calendar, both of which I use often. Durable. Is very good.... better of i expect... Nice cheep WONDERFUL, WONDERFUL, WONDERFUL.. got the phone before they said I would and it was PERFECT. I was nervous buying a phone in this manner but, I was worried for nothing. The phone was great and the seller was fast, honest and had a great product. I AM SOOOOOO HAPPY. Phone in great condition but crappy phone in my opinion. awesome Had the phone for a day, first impressions are great. Phone is great. Very powerful, great screen, responsive. I\\'m running full Linux on it without breaking a sweat. It\\'s unlocked, and the process of transferring my service from my iPhone\\'s nano sim to a new (compatible) micro sim was painless on AT&T. One thing. As of 8-7-2016, it\\'s difficult to root. VERY difficult to root (Kingo and King don\\'t work, nor does basically any other popular one-touch root). Ships with Lollipop, and the only way to root is apparently to upgrade to Marshmallow, and mine won\\'t, so I\\'m waiting on a reply from ASUS as to what to do. Be wary of that. Also, little things, but the battery seemingly shifts when moved from side to side. It never comes out of contact, but mildly annoying, also the home buttons and stuff don\\'t light up if that matters.Bottom line: Build quality 8/10, Software 7/10 (Rooting 3/10), Battery 9/10, Screen 10/10, Heat management 8.5/10P.S. Tap the build number 7 times in Settings > About > Software to get developer settings. Works as intended with no issues. exelente Producto I\\'ve purchase this Nokia Asha 306 as a \"GIFT\"..., during my visit on September 2013 In USA. Coming back home in Africa ( Douala-cameroon) I\\'ve offered this to my girl friend, After a week of using the touchscreen doesn\\'t work properly, and time to time this fone were missing and loosing the local network signal. Poor communication whenever you need to call or receive a call... Most of the capabilities do not work properly, and make me disapointed about this product.......Unfortunatly i\\'m already far away from Us and no way to claim the reimbursmentMy Advise to any Customer it\\'s: Don\\'t buy that product to avoid facing the same disapointment I ordered my phone for a FANTASTIC price, it wa shipped within a few days, I had a tracking number and it arrives before its scheduled time. When I recieved th phone it was exactly how they said it would look and I was VERY HAPPY!! THANK YOU! Good phone ...long battery duration. ..4 stars coz we cannot pair with it galaxy watches. .. Excelent i recomend you El telefono es muy práctico y completo. La camara toma buenas fotos y es bastante funcional.Nokia se la comió con esta versión económica del N97 I am pleased with this Blackberry phone! The product and seller met all expectations. The phone is great. My son is very happy with it! This was a gift that made my man very happy. It has a great camera and does good video. Some of the controls are a small (volume rocker) EXCELENTE RECOMENDADO Good Phone! love it The device stalls ALL THE TIME!!!!! Do you know how frustrating it is to wait 60 seconds to get to the menu? I do! My curve is light-years faster than my 9760. Nothing seems wrong. As soon as I get my new sim card, I\\'ll be greatly satisfied. It is a unique mobile. It works well and makes oyu independant of the iBoys and Droids. This is how a smart phone should work ! I really like the fone but that battery looses charge too fast. fine great case! has good texture so I don\\'t lose my grip. This is a great starter phone for a kid or for someone who would like an android phone but doesn\\'t need the horsepower or 4G data. I like that the phone is just over $100 and is not subsidy locked so I can take it to any GSM carrier. It only has 4GB of storage, but it has a micro SD card expansion slot, you can you expand your storage pretty cheaply, a feature missing from most flagship phones. For the price, you can\\'t beat it. I looked past the fact the this phone came from the middle east somewhere. The phone does not work in CHINA with a China sim card but it was sold as an unlocked GSM phone.. If it was a GSM phone it should work in any country An excellent powerful phone at a reasonable price. The service was wonderful and speedy. The only displeasure that I have is the position of the charging port. I would have preferred if it were at the bottom of the phone. So far, so good. I hesitate to give five stars, simply because I\\'ve only had this phone for a week. My primary concern with this kind of purchase, as is demonstrated in some reviews with such products, is whether this previous generation of smartphone is truly new and authentic. Once the newest and hottest smartphone version hits the market, any remaining new stock of the previous version is discontinued or swiped up fast (particularly if the previous version is better than the newest). As anyone who has been looking for these models can attest, a lot of the options are refurbished, open-box, unlocked, or most importantly claimed as new but not really. Then you have the issue with whether the model is \"international\", GSM or something else that might prevent it from doing what the buyer wants it to do.So, I\\'m happy that I found this at a reasonable price and from a seller that I was able to research and develop some confidence in. I was also able to rely on the Amazon return policy in case things didn\\'t work out. BlutekUSA is the seller, in my case, and I have been quite happy with the result. I believe the phone is indeed new, and perhaps even factory-unlocked versus the seller doing it. And it is the real deal, with all the standard, original accessories included.The phone itself works quite well, compared to my Galaxy S3. I have T-Mobile, and this is an AT&T unlocked phone (that\\'s what the \"A\" means, in the G900A model), but I was able to simply take my SIM out of my old phone and insert it into the new phone, do some manual setting of the 4G ling so that I could highlight and pick T-Mobile (more networks, mobile networks, APN setting to T-Mobile), and everything works fine. The performance is improved. The battery is stronger, longer lasting and recharges much faster than the Galaxy S3. It was already updated to Android 5.0 Lollipop, and while not a rooted device, I\\'m satisfied with the operation. I have 45 days with the HTC smartphone and is presenting a problem with the rear camera is not working. Check with HTC and they told me that the problem is hardware. And that I take to chcek it where I buy this smartphone. Please, I need a solution. Arrived on time with no issues 1st one wouldn\\'t activate on ATT network. Seller was great and send out a replacement. Replacement woudn\\'t activate either. Spent an hour on chat with ATT and got it to activate. Worked for about 2 hour and then lost connection. Connection would come and go for a couple hours, usually came back after a reboot or when connected to computer via USB. Then would disconnect when unplugged or after a call was made. Totally unusable. Seller again offered to send a replacement but by that time the phone was smashed into many small pieces. Too bad, I really like the old school RAZR form and function, but I guess I\\'ll be forced into using new technology. I\\'m glad I chose LG G3. I love all it\\'s features. The GPS, camera and the sound is amazing, never had the sound so sharp with my Sony Xperia. My co workers are jealous. Will recommend. Wanted a simple phone, and this is it although Great call would like to sell extras to bump the price of monthly phone bill up to rival a regular cell phone bill.Stick to the basic phone bill and it is worthwhile, but if you want extras , buy a regular phone to get the features you want. Reception at my home location is poor to non existent so can not use at home but I do take it on the road where I can expect to have reception. overall not bad but if you use the camera at all stay away from this phone you can not take a picture the is not blurred. I will not use it long, you get what you pay for. I purchased this phone took it to the verizon corporate store and was told it was not a verizon phone.Wrip off!!!! Seriously so impressed. It came new, in the box and it even had the plastic wrap still around the box. Took it to Verizon to activate it and haven\\'t had a single problem with it. Thank god. (: I like it a lot thanks Very happy with the phone Inspite of few bugs and slowness, I like it. Fingerprint recg is superb, overall a nice package. 100% recomendado I\\'m new to the android phone world. This is the highest end phone I\\'ve ever had.First, the phone arrived a couple days *ahead of time.* Awesome.The phone is made of plastic on the back and sides but it\\'s made in a far more sturdy presentation than what I expected. I\\'m very pleased with that.Overall the phone is great and the screen is vibrant. This phone seems like a great bang for the buck. The camera is pretty good too--though I\\'ve only taken a few photos in not the best of light and have yet to really test out the camera fully, but the images thus far are good nonetheless.At first I didn\\'t realize a protective plastic covers the back camera lens, so, my first picture I took with the camera came out not very clear looking. But once I took the plastic off the colors and detail popped out more.The phone has google voice commands too. You can tell the phone to call certain numbers. Very cool!The one downside is that the battery--when watching videos etc.--does not last as long as I hoped. Between 1 to 10 with 100 being the highest, I\\'d give the battery a 5 or maybe 6 at the most. I wouldn\\'t give it below a 5 though. It\\'s still decent enough for a battery.I highly recommend this phone. Great phone! it\\'s a very good phone for the price! , camera without flash, isn\\'t problem, battery charge is so long (2 days) a lot, i\\'m happy with my Moto E!! buy this phone NOW!!!! Was very satisfied with my purchase. Great phone great deal. Will buy again when the time comes around. Hopefully soon. The cell phon never work well Good phone. I needed this for Australia and it worked awesome. The touch screen is a little off but it does the job of making calls and using maps just fine. does take a little bit of time to get used to the touch. It\\'s fun that this new version of Jitterbug does more, but that makes the phone more complex, of course.I bought the phone for my 70 IQ sister, and she needed more training than I expected. She was moving up after having the older, simpler version for years, so I expected her to simply take it and start using it.It\\'s a nice phone, and she loves the red color. She also likes the idea that it has a camera. Now we\\'ll see if she can use that without having me around. it\\'s ok Delivery was prompt. Great value for the money. It would be great if there is a switch for volume control and turning the display off so it does not come on when any key is pressed unintentionally. Can\\'t complain, it\\'s a Samsumg. Works perfectly Bad product freeze n goes through an unending loop or power cycle to turn on. Looks nice but serious app problem. Won\\'t recommend to anyone at all save your money. Amazon however did refund my money back... The phone would not get service. I purchased 3 phone s on amazon. Only one was not hacked. I will not buy another phone on amazon. Good It was a good phone with good voice quality, but it has a bad charging and battery life. It quit taking a charge and I only had it a little over one month. I decided after I contacted the seller (Just Cellular, who were very good about return policy) that I would get a refund for this phone. You can\\'t get apps for this phone. The battery, you might get three or four days even if it is sitting idle. Overall I would it (0-10) a 5 for charging and an 8 for quality. It says it is IP67, but mine died when battery go heated up during exposure to direct sunlight in Arizona recently. This happened not once but several times. Also the seal for USB connector is poorly designed since it does not accommodate other micro USB dongles and I had to file off the opening for it accept non-B15 supplied micro USB. It\\'s nothing but a regular Android with a \\'fancy\\'-ly designed exterior and expensively licensed logo of Caterpillar. I wasted my $300. I have used HTC phones for years. I love this phone. I didn\\'t get the M8 because I couldn\\'t afford it. It doesn\\'t matter to me because this one is still an upgrade from what I had. The phone was very easy to set up on straight talk. I love this phone and it\\'s so easy to set up your personal preferences. I was lost with the Samsung 3 that I kept only for 2 months. Great phone. It is hard to use with one hand unless you have very large hands. But using this makes me use my ipad mini less. Excelent product The cell phone never turn on, is damaged. i have other before, this cell is amazing, but nokia have some problems whith the power on... The phone came in on time and looked awesome. It was fantastic at first worked great but by the third month of having it the phone has screwed up completely and i have to buy a new phone now because of it. Dont waste your time and money with this product. Im serious...you will find yourself pissed off and broke without a phone el equipo cumple contodas las especificaciones que se establecen en el articulo, muy buen equipo, recomendado a los usuarios de los mismos Excellent replacement given our circumstances, but the iOS was so outdated it took almost 2 hours to update it. I recently bought a new Lumia 920 and it is stunning. Battery life is phenomenal (I use it mainly for sending emails, texting, some web browsing). The other day, I didn\\'t have to charge it for almost 2 days!! Screen looks amazing, love that I can sync it with my other windows 8 devices. All in all, WELL worth the money. The phone came with a bad speaker I could return but not replace took it to cell repair place cost me another fifty dollars needed the phone.. Battery running out too fast! Price is cheap, you have to charge it everyday. Excellent buy! It was exactly what I wanted and.my fiancee loves her new iPhone. Upgrade for my wife from tracfone, took it to Verizon Corporate store for setup, ready to go in 15 minutes. Ported her old # over. Screen is too small for me (my iPhone 6s is easier for me to see) . Bought this refurbished from Noble Planet after looking at their history. I\\'m very happy with Noble Planet and with this phone. Just like original This was NOT a new phone! Screen protector was reapplied and the charger cord was dirty and wrapped in masking tape. The charger was also ripped open. Not ready for prime time due to software bugs and hardware quality control issues. Due to quality control issues or a design defect, the screen clicked when touched on the lower left corner when the physical keyboard was closed. When switching from a keyboard open position to a keyboard closed position, rather than a smooth motion, the screen would catch or snag at the top.Although there are some welcome modifications made by Blackberry to the Android OS, they\\'re unfortunately rushed to market and buggy. As a result, the phone ran hot and had poor battery life.Customers should not be expected to pay a top of the line $700 premium prices for a phone with these sorts of issues. Love my phone! It has everything! Would buy it again! Nice phone, so far !!! Bought for my husband, he loves it! As described, works perfect, used phone but couldn\\'t tell because has no scratches, just minor wear on one corner which was easily covered with a case. It\\'s a great phone. Screm is very brillant and all apps running quick. This phone will become one of my favorite. excellent phone. Quick delivery, everything as advertise. Extremely satisfied. Samsung S4 is a very very good phone. -still. i don\\'t like this phone I use only one manth and after no mour so please don t bye this phone Works great, very good product Good, simple starter watch. Its features are accurately described and useful. Unless you have a sim, however, there are some things you cannot use. Still a fun watch and worth the price. works very well, no trouble excellent product, thank you very much ... excellent productI likedand recommend it to those who needexcellenti liked recomementvery very very very good Love my hott pink phone excelentt...!! Muy bien gracias. I am loving this phone. I don\\'t know if the extra 2gb of ram was really necessary but I tend to load my phone up with tons of apps and the relatively huge storage is serving me nicely. I am using ~ 18gb out of 64 and have barely touched the SD card I added.The UI has been snappy and overall the phone seems very responsive.I have had a few glitches where the home button seemed to go crazy and act like I kept pressing it, but that seems to have cleared up.I am using this phone on Verizon and hope to try a prepaid MVNO on AT&T towers to see who has the best reception in our rural area. On Verizon reception seems to be good. I wanted a decent smartphone without paying alot and this seems to be a good phone so far. I have not used the phone camera yet, so I can\\'t say about that. I am disappointed that I cannot open more windows when checking email. It has everything I need otherwise. I am so pleased with my Htc Evo 4g. I ordered it Saturday and received it MondayI had it activated in 10 minutes. I am very pleased and will order from this seller again. It came in perfect condition Dosent hold a very good charge but other then that I love it .its really good ...and I love the screen size The speakers fail and it is supposed to be new Working good I like the phone added a 64gb card to it. Good battery so far. Came with 2 cases and ear buds. Operating system good just hate that there is no app drawer.speaker is good, wish u could update to marshmallow. But u wanted a big screen and a lot of memory so this was a great buy. Love this!!! Only problem: I tend to misplace my phone. I went from a hot pink case (easy to spot, even in the dark) to this dark blue, which is nearly impossible to find, especially if you have darker furniture. But the polkadots are too die for! Love love love. It also works excellent, My phone got knocked off the kitchen counter by my 90lb rottweiler and stepped on, and not even the case got damaged. Definitely impressed and would buy again for myself or as a gift. The phone is great. Delivered quick. The 5s is a quality piece of equipment working as I expected it After only owning the phone for less then 6 months it decided not to work anymore (never dropped or touched water) called samsung support and they said the IMEI/Serial number was not on recorded so they were not able to service it under there 1yr warranty service. Went to there Samsung Rep. at Best Buy and got the same answer even thought they tried to fix it. Be aware that if you purchase this phone and if it becomes defective Samsung will not service it because it doesn\\'t exists on there database. It\\'s wonderful Phone is amazing I\\'ve had it for a while now and no issues. Luv this damn phone with every fiber of my being. It\\'s a great phone, so much bigger and lighter than my girlfriend iphone 5. She\\'s jealous now and wants this phone too. ITS A VERY NICE PRODUCT... IT CAME AS I SPECTED… I RECOMMENDED… QUALITY 95%... WE ARE USING IT WITH NO TROUBLE AT ALL 100% OK… Great phone, fast delivery. Muy satisfecha con el producto recibido, cumplio con todas las caracteristica descritas en la publicacion de la paginaGracias, no dudaria en comprarle nuevamente Did not realize it had to have a sims card to work Awesome product & awesome service. A++++ Nice ! When this phone arrived, it either wasn\\'t unlocked or wasn\\'t an ATT compatible phone which is what we supposedly bought. It won\\'t activate on our line which makes it basically pointless. This phone is garbage. Battery life is terrible. I\\'ll be getting something else soon. Only good thing about it is the camera EXCELENTE PROC DUCTO RECOMIENDO BIEN .... . . . . . . . . . .. . . . . . most durable phone I have ever had, battery lasts great and it does not lag very much for a cheaper phone. the one problem I have had with a few of these phones is the earpiece going bad. I\\'m wondering if my phone is even new.... starting to regret buying this phone & I just received it today. I cant even silence the camera shutter sound... Beautiful phone, works great! Great buy i love this watch cell phone E Smart.it connect with my cell phone without no problem.love ittttttt.... The power button not working have to plug it in to charge whenever I need to use it so I had to pay to fix that not good that why give it 2 but otherwise is a good phone PROs: Powerful, fast, very stylish and has an excellent screen display. CONs: Expensive, can\\'t remove battery and no memory expansion slot. Clean and work as a new one!! The best android experience.. Pure from Google one of the best Nexus phones following the late Galaxy Nexus. No phone can beat these features with that price but the One Plus One...if you can buy one :D bigger then expected but dont expect it to do a lot then u expected and they may gliche up so be careful Perfect ! Perrine worked fine, poor support from blu products for device. No Android 4.4 - kit kat like online says. Buy this off brand at one risk. You get what you pay for. Bearly no accessories for device other then what you get with phone exist. Normal fast Amazon shipping. I brought this phone one years ago, but it still new and working good Plain and simple. Everything that I wanted. Excellent, fast safe and quality Product update. After a year only one of the phones is still working properly. Still not a bad phone for the money and served the purpose.Purchased 4 of these for the family. Have had for almost a year. Had to return 1 because it kept shutting off but replacement works OK. Can\\'t beat the price for what you get. Main complaint is that the camera shutter is very slow. excellent I purchased this for my trip to visit my family in the United States. This phone worked great with a great battery life. It was a tad bit on the slow side sometimes when navigating different applications. But for the price, I was not faltered by it at all. I used a \"Straight Talk\" sim card and it worked flawlessly with quick 4 G speeds. No complaints. all well excellent product... Perfect price, now that Ting has a GSM saving lots of money, only problem was that it came with Kikat if you want to upgrade to Lollipop you will need to borrow an at&t sim and do the update or you could root and apply the update manually with lollipop installed not going to be getting a new phone for some time. Great phone thank you! So good I\\'m buying another one I\\'ve had this for about 4 months now. I totally love how sleek it feels. Really premium piece of machine. But you need a good case, it feels that fragile. I\\'ve had a Samsung phone for over 4 years so using this was no difficult task. Nothing too surprising. There are things I don\\'t use much though....such as the edge screen. Though the night clock really works well for me. It does seem to be waterproof but I will not willingly test that. But I notice I can still use the interface with droplets on the screen. This was not the case with my previous phone. It is still fairly new so the speed is great. Battery life is awesome. I can confidently leave home without the charger for an entire day of heavy use. No overheating. Overall, good purchase. I would buy it again but I have no intention of losing or destroying it and I don\\'t plan on splurging on another upgrade for the next 2-3years. I hung onto my S4 for that long. Horrible watch would not connect to my android. Several tries and the micro Sd card wouldn\\'t even fit whatsoever. I was unsure about my purchase on this device seconds after purchase. I have tried many budget android devices in hopes of finding a low cost but high performing tablet or phone. Lets say that I haven\\'t been too lucky.Over the past 2 weeks I have been researching all of Blu\\'s phones and I thought I had found the one! I was looking for 4 things I wanted most from a phone.1. SD Card. Memory is a big one for me as I have a large music collection and don\\'t want to waste my data on streaming music. What I need is a device that is compatible with 128GB micro sd card and this one is. The Amazon description says up to 64GB, I was very happy to see that 128GB worked. I did have one issue and it could have been the app I was using but I had to tell iSyncr app to send the music to the internal memory not the SD card to get the files on the SD card. Very Strange but it worked.2. The display had to be as good as a iPhone 4. I can\\'t use any display that isn\\'t IPS and low resolution. If I place my phone on my desk and look at it from a extreme angle I want it to look the same as looking directly at it. This phone has a great screen, I would rate it a 9 out of 10. I was very happy with the quality of the IPS display. The bright vivid colors and the touch input was dead on every time. The one place that it did disappoint me was in the OS, the gradients where not smooth so not sure if this was Ice Cream Sandwich or the display.3. Speed!!! Budget Android devices lag very bad when scrolling through large blog posts or any page with a lot of pictures. The speed of the Octa core processor didn\\'t disappoint me. I have a very large music collection and running Player Pro in album view scrolled and rendered album art very quickly.4. Battery life. I really can\\'t talk to much about the battery life as I have only used it for two days. The first day the battery had 50% life out of the box. After charging it to 70% I started loading on the apps and using wifi to transfer my music over to the sd card in the phone. the wifi transfer ran the battery down very fast and had to be plugged in before it ran out.The biggest disappointment and the reason why I sent this phone back to Amazon is that I couldn\\'t get the Bluetooth to stream audio smoothly. I have Bluetooth in my car and the music skipped like a scratched cd. This could be a bug in the Ice Cream Sandwich rom \"The phones OS\" and could be fixed when the phone gets the Kit Kat update.Overall I love this phone and would have kept it if the Bluetooth worked. If Blu updates this phone to Kit Kat I may try this phone again to see if the problem has been fixed.Not sure if it\\'s possible but stock Google play rom on this phone would make it shine and remove any quirks I found like no access to quick toggles in the notification pull down menu. A extra gig of ram would have really helped in a few places too. To complicated😢 Went back to iPhone. WORK PERFECTLY! I rarely post reviews however, I have to for this phone. I have always been a Samsung user ever since my first Galaxy S2. I just sold my S5 and was using my S4. The S4 was so dated could not even have two gmail accounts on this phone. So looked for a temporary phone until the Note6 arrives in Sept/August. This phone is wonderful, the finger print reader is faster than my old S5. The S5 finger print reader was a button that seem to get stuck once in awhile. The A9 is not a physical button but a recessed cut out. I\\'ve had this phone for two days and it has updated just as much as my Nexus Tablet which is loved(running 6.0 Marshmallow). Works with ATT, cheaper than ATT. ATT sells this for $520 on a payment plan, this was $349 with prime Shipping same day. The model number of this phone is NM82pq9120.The phone reception is not what was expected sometimes I only get one bar (text a lot). I live around Philadelphia and never had any issues with ATT so it may be the phone. other than that I\\'M LOVING THIS HTC ONE A9. For the price if you need an unlocked no contract replacement phone you can do no better than this behemoth.... The battery is amazing, last days on a single charge. the phone is good working well %100 y\\'all can see the specs as well I love this phone, better than described. fast shipping, strong packing. Great! I do not like the interface/software. Way to limited/ing. I tried to replace my Samsung Galaxy S5. Mostly it is possible.Pros:Big, clear, and very responsive screen, high volume level for media files and ring tones. Very good 4G LTE, at least for AT&T, and WiFi, clean Android 4.3, without any additions, like launchers etc.Battery is huge!Cons:Power button and volume control are located on the same site and too close.I could not find acceptable hard case for this phone.Some extra Huawei programs/icons which could not be removed.Android Lollipop 5 still not available in more then month after announcement.Some third party program does not work properly: (Helium Backup, some others).Conclusion:I still use Samsung S5 with a smaller screen. I may need a little more time to move to Huawei. Best phone ever. Native Android rocks. Samsung should think about to use the native android OS. So far so good This is really 3 questions to allow me to complete my purschase. Does the model Titan HD 550a have sensors including compass and accelerometers? Is a spare battery available? Gorilla glass or, should i get a screen protector?Update: Aug. 6; Received the phone today! 5 Stars based on the features. I took a chance based on the $69 Amazon price for this phablet. My questions were resolved very positively. 9 sensors! Makes this a good candidate for astronomy tools, as I hoped. Gorilla Glass 3, stated by support. Included case and screen protector with my shipment. Front and rear flash for the cameras. Dual LED flash for the rear camera may give a range of white balance for HDR photos. It looks great for the future....Oct. 14. 2015 - 2 months into my ownership and I am writing this update on the phone so, there is that.The amazing thing is ... A week ago I pulled up my pants and this phone flew into the toilet. I not so quickly romoved the covers and battery, laid out to dry and, moved my sim to an older phone. The next day my 4 year old grandson came to with the reassembled \\'damp\\' phone. The rear LEDs are shining like nuts, I panic, fieldstrip it again and toss the parts in a box. I try it this week and, it\\'s OK!I am very happy as this has exceeded almost all my expectations. 1st month I kept pushing the limits until I had 160 apps and, couldn\\'t update any apps. I backed off to about 130 for the past month and it has gone well. I installed the 64GB microSD, added tape to the back of my SIM to make it more secure and, packaged the phone in the supplied gel case and screen protector. I try to keep it in my shirt pocket from which it falls from chair height weekly...I do wish I could use the camera(rear) in low light more easily. some different workings but very nice phone tho so far disappointed with the camera Bjvjjbkvjvj OK FEELS LIKE A TOY It was basically brand new was def worth the money I spent. Pro apple is a great place to buy from. Blue life xl a great phone for the price works great the battery hold up for about a day with normal operation if you are playing games you have to charge it but I love it haven\\'t had any problems with it having so much fun with it Is nice product... Good phone but when you call someone or get a call you can\\'t talk in the phone. The person on the other line can\\'t hear you. Too slow and lags in response to the touch. I purchased an iPhone 5s from MassTechtronics, and I am very unsatisfied. The Post said that there were no problems with the phone. When I got the phone, it already had problems. It keeps freezing up, and turning off. Every time I try to text someone, it tries to do the typing itself. Any time I am on social media, it Scrolls through the posts and likes things by itself. To fix it, I have to lock and unlock the screen every few seconds. Most of the time, I can\\'t even unlock the screen. I have to restart the phone sometimes. Finding this vendor was what makes Amazon shopping so great. Purchased for a friend who is a faithful and true Blackberry fan, and the Style flip phone is a classic. It also takes great pix. I purchased this cell phone for my son, he said he liked it and it works good, good phone for the price First, I ordered gold, but got gray. I needed a new phone, so I let that slide. Second, the sensitivity on this phone in particular was way off the charts. I googled how to reduce this and nothing worked. Still, I put up with that. Then, shortly after the return policy expired, the phone started having glitch problems that looked \"matrix-y\" in a way. When this occurred, I had to restart the phone, only for it to happen again shortly after. Either this was a dud phone in the batch or it had been refurbished and sold as new, so be leary of buying from seller shalem halleluja. everything is good The connection with the charger is not good. This phone doesnt work with 4g/LTE I feel cheated.Very low quality headphones, left and right channels are swapped and left is a lot louder than right excellent Excelente This phone stoped working after 1 hour...it just turned off and coudn\\'t turn on again. I am highly dissapointed, because this is second phone I ordered on Amazon, and with the first one I also had problems...so I will never again order anything from this site!!! Although it was the wrong product I ordered I love it. great great ! I had to buy a used product.But it did not contain the earphones.I\\'ve purchased a full component.However, the product is a new product. I bought two supposedly new phones one has loose screws which were already removed. the other one the scroll button has frozen. I\\'m on vacation with two useless phones. You need to do better I did not like it. The watch would not sync to my phone correctly and lost it\\'s BT connection when less than 3 feet from my phone. To be fair, I didn\\'t expect a lot for the price, but, I did expect at least those two things. I am returning this item. Fantastic device, great specs, extremely smooth and snappy. The price is fantastic for what it is. The minimal skin they put on over vanilla Android is great. No problems caused by the UI or any of their custom features.So why 3 stars?There\\'s no way to enter the Bootloader. Can\\'t unlock the device. Can\\'t replace the Recovery. No root, no custom ROM. Complete lockdown. Not cool.I returned mine because of how locked down it is. Hopefully they open it up in the future. This *could be* an amazing phone, but at this moment it\\'s crippled by the inability to control it the way I want. Seller is helpful and knowledgeable. Phone works great! Wireless hub were really great , the phone is amazing Ordered this for my teenage son and it is a great phone. Great fantastic perfect! I love this phone. I recently switched from a major carrier where I had the Galaxy S6 Edge and this phone tops it 100% in my opinion. I haven\\'t been able to figure out if you can have different ringtones for different contacts yet, but if not this is still a fantastic phone. I\\'m glad I waited for it. After being a happy android user for years I decided to make the switch to this phone. I am very happy with the build quality. The screen is bigger than my nexus 4 with nice color Phone was very, very sluggish. Apps froze all the time. Screen is very grainy. GPS (which I use a lot for my job) was all over the place. It seemed to freeze or misread my location often. I\\'m returning this phone. I\\'ve ordered the Lenovo 5.5 phone that has much better specs. It costs $36 more, but money well spent to have phone that can at least work most of the time and handle everyday tasks.Some pros is that it had a nice heavy weight to it. This might not be a pro for you, however.It also came with a nice case and screen protectorsThe biggest pro was the battery life. Of course with a new phone it is always good but this one seemed especially long lasting. Probably because of the huge battery size. Phone is a Christmas present for grand daughter who really wants one but can\\'t get it for herself. I think she will really love it. Price was right, packing secure, and delivery fast. excelent This phone, sold by TJ Global only works in the UK (D855). It does not work in the US and never will. LG makes them locked to a specific geographic area only, and does not unlock them:LG G3 D855 for EuropeLG G3 D850 for AT&TLG G3 D851 for T-MobileLG G3 D852 for Canada (info found on GSM Arena). One can find the correct phone (at least so I hope, just ordered a second one) by typing the correct number, for ex. D851 for the T Mobile, together with the name and characteristics of the phone. NONE of the 16 GB (and there are many) are good for the US though. Why the sellers do not bother to add this precious tidbit if information up front is beyond me! None of them has this very, very important detail listed in the characteristics, as they should!!! Or list it conspicuously: for Europe, AT&T, Asia...whatever! LG customer help did not help at all when asked (got the advise to buy it from T Mobile or Amazon...I had bought one that does not work! Buy it again??!!). What a bother and what a pain to miss having a phone for so long on account of such a preventable error. This is a good phone but the main issue is the lack of update from HTC (stuck on Windows 8.0), HTC leaves the providers the job to build the updates. But the providers have too many phone to manage, then you can wait until the pigs fly. I Freaking Love This Phone!! It\\'s So Big And The Gold Color Is Cute, Plus It Came With A Clear Case. My Straight Talk At&t Sim Card Works Great In It. It\\'s Definitely Better Than I Thought I Was Gonna Be. A Must Buy My Mom Is Gonna Buy A White One Next. Brought for my teenage daughter..she says she loves it! Excelente This was advertised as an international version unlocked. When I received the phone it was full of AT&T software, including a block on the tethering function. in addition, the phone reboots by itself every 10-15 min. I have requested a return. The phone is great, but the charger is too bad Changed from an Iphone to this phone and I am glad I did. I love the larger display. Learning the windows system has been tricky but fun. The hardest part for me was finding the right software at the marketplace to use to change the network settings. I pay four one of they Phone that was stolen I pay 700$ am returning the phone to get my money back cause it\\'s a stolen phone this person use a stolen Credit card so he or she stole some one card and Purchase Maybe over 200 or more phones to resell to ppl like me who was crazy enough to pay 700$ over da wab to some crazy person I never seen b-4 to top it off I am a federal agent I will find you I will not sleep until I remove you Very good phone. Reached my expectation exactly Came with very small print user manual booklet.Searched internet for larger print of it.Unnecto Air 5.0 User Manual...Also it was hard to find how to open the phone,to install battery and SIMS Card.Over all, Android phone is great. As expected I bought this iPhone as a Christmas gift, so I purchased it early. Upon opening it on Christmas only the speakerphone was working. You could not hear it up-to-the-ear. Apple told us, after we described the problem over the telephone, that it was probably only the speaker module and it would cost about $50. I recently took it to Apple to have the module replaced and was told by them that several parts inside the phone was missing and some parts did not even belong to Apple. Because of the modifications, Apple said that it was no longer a iPhone and would not even work on it. I understand that because of the length of time the phone cannot be returned, but in the future, please sell items EXACTLY AS ADVERTISED AND NOT MODIFIED. It\\'s a good phone but haven\\'t been able to figure out how to work some features on it such as turning on the flashlight and storing extra contact info. If anyone know how to work these features on the big button seniors phone please let me know What the text doesn\\'t mention is that the phone I received was the world version, not the North American version. This meant that I would couldn\\'t take advantage of LTE speed and was stuck with 4G. VERY happy with my purchase!!! It was a Christmas gift for my husband and he adores it. Uses it every minute of the day! Thanks for a great product and super speedy delivery! After 6 months the phone brokes his procesor...and reboots all the time. And i don\\'t have warranty form the seller! I order this phone Samsung prism and what I got was a phone the look like on but is was from china and the branch was huiawei WTF where that is from great product. shipment on time. great price. Wow, this is such a great phone, at an unbelievable price. Sure enough, it\\'s the end of 2014 and this is the 2013 version of the Moto X, but that does not in any way compromise the overall experience.The best things that this phone has to offer are:1) Original Google design of the operating system interface. This is no comparison to what you would get with a Samsung Galaxy S phone, which has numerous alterations and additions to Google\\'s original, beautiful design.2) Fast software updates. When I activated the phone, it downloaded several updates that brought it right to Android KitKat (4.4) and Android 5.0 (Lollipop) is going to be released for this phone any day now. In contrast to updates on the iPhone for example, the updates on the Moto X bring along *all* of the new software features even for this older phone, and they don\\'t slow it down to a crawl.3) Touchless controls. Just saying \"Ok Google Now\", or more recently any user-defined phrase, will wake up the phone without you having to press any buttons or the screen. This is perfect especially when driving or if you don\\'t want to take it out of your pocket/handbag to do something quick, like setting a reminder or checking what\\'s next on your calendar. This implementation is also pretty secure, as it trains to your voice -- nobody else can unlock your phone, unless they have a high-quality recording of course.4) No bloatware from carriers.5) Despite having a large 4.7\" screen, the body is extremely small. That\\'s because the bezels are kept to a minimum, and the home/back/task buttons are soft-keys on the screen. This is a perfect, clean, minimalist solution, eliminating any physical buttons on the front. This also means that the phone has great long-term viability: none of those buttons can ever break (unless you break the screen of course).6) Glance notifications. The phone smartly shows notifications on its lock screen periodically, making the need for unlocking and checking individual apps / app tray unnecessary. Like on a Lumia, this can even be triggered by waving the hand above the screen, and you then also have the opportunity of unlocking the phone with a swipe on the screen. It follows another long-term benefit: You\\'ll likely use the lock/unlock button a lot less, making unlikely that this button will break even after many years.7) It\\'s extremely fast, responsive, and smooth.The camera is decent, however, if you are into photography I would probably recommend the Lumia 830, which should be not much more expensive, or a Lumia 1020. But you do get a nifty slow-motion cam, and even HDR on this Moto X. Great phone I have to return this device. There is no way to use this device on another carriers system I thought this phone was new, but it was refurbished. It has a few bugs still. I had to buy the D821 model in order to make sure it will works in Brazil.Sometimes the camera focus just stop working, everything is blurred despite the camera app saying it\\'s ok. OS is version 4.4.2 (so theoretically the previous camera bug is fixed), restarting the device and tried other camera apps but the problems persists. It can stay in this state for hours. My hope is to be a software problem.Previously I\\'ve owned a Nexus S and a Galaxy Nexus and never had any problem with these.Otherwise the device is good, screen is big and have nice colors, very fast. Battery life is par with my previous Galaxy. Don\\'t buy it I have this phone for only a month , so far so good. everything is working fine , super fast shipping, right price and just as described. all good Awesome phone. Even better with PureNexus Happy with it. 2 hours+ to set up. horrible. Wont use sims Excelent bueno I\\'m giving this phone a 4star because the battery that cane with the phone is messed up. It dies randomly around 14%-17%. Also there\\'s a weird salon colored block that takes up 3/4 of the screen its really hard to notice at first but once you see it its hard to not see it. Also apps sometimes crash. Only way to fix it is to turn the screen off which is no big deal. But over all I like the phone. The phone works OK. There are couple things I don\\'t like. 1. The sensitivity on touch screen isn\\'t great. Sometimes I have to touch several times for it to acknowledge. 2. The internal memories isn\\'t enough. The memory I can free is only about 500MB. It is very slow to response. 3. The position of where you touch on the screen isn\\'t accurate. You think you touch the a, and it could be the q or s instead. The cell is using 4.4.2 Android. It doesn\\'t allow files transfer from internal memory to SD card. It runs out of memory very quickly. Don\\'t expect it will upgrade the OS any time soon. Very good i love the feature on this phone ,and the ship time was excellent received phone in 2days, was very excited. opened box, put in A T & T sims card. volume good with calls.........but cannot download any apps from play store, always saying time out. works very slow. Thinking about returning phone : ( no fun if can\\'t download music and games. Bah Humbug !!!!!!! Simply put, this phone didn\\'t work for more than two weeks. I really do like this phone, the only real complaint I have is that the speaker on the ear piece and the loud speaker itself are not nearly as loud as my previous phone but overall a very nice phone. She loves it like a newborn baby This phone is simply amazing. The A9 processor is on point, multitasking is a major key, live wallpaper and 3D Touch is amazing. I\\'m glad that I bought the phone off amazon and it\\'s backed by their guarantee if you purchase it from their warehouse. I Like this phone but I barely have signal. I wish it was 4g instead. Takes good pictures but the battery dies to fast even if you dim it to the lowest point. No Bad It is impossible for me to review and rate this item as I have not received it as yet. I have been buying from Amazon since 2004 and am truly disappointed with this. I really need the phone and it is proving quite inconvenient waiting for so long to receive it. It is one month now and I really need it. Getting the money back is not the issue right now, I need the phone. Very good phone for the price, Almost as good as my laptop. Xperia z3+ is the best Its OK for the price you are paying. It\\'s too slow and camera take normal pics, it\\'s good to carry because of the size and you can download all your apps normally. Sometimes the sound is not good and you have to use the speaker mode. Like the phone and it was what I expected. I would recommend this to my friends and to my family. Not good deal ,battery life and phone not good LOVE IT ! SIMPLE OPERATION! Excelent Smartphone and Seller! Nokia the best for life! Awful...!, the phone is not a genuine Nokia, is a cheap copy...! excellent purchase, recommended seller good The phone lost it\\'s imei number after a month. It is pretty much useless for calling or texting. I like but three stars ok😊 I received my phone 3 days ago and although the phone is absolutely amazing and the features come in quite handy on a day to day basis buying this phone refurbished it will not receive a charge so will have to return it in hopes I get one that does. The case is exactly what I expected Works perfect for the adapters/charger/plugs from India. So far no complains/issues I got it as a gift for my brother. It showed up and was set to the country code for Mexico and was set up in spanish. Trying to change it was a 3 day event with hours of customer service calls so I returned

works fine. 4 stars only because blu doesn\\'t have a update out yet for android 5.0 to 5.1 or to 6.0 product was as described. very pleased with purchase. i waited a little while before posted a review to see if there were any mechanical issues which there hasn\\'t been thus far. thank you very much great phone for my needs. the only issue is; it doesn\\'t take clear pics and it takes like 4 hrs to charge other than that it\\'s a pretty good phone this phone is awesome for the price!!! i love motorola gestures and the fingerprint scanner works well. battery lasts the full day with heavy use, probably two days with minimal use. immediately worked with verizon sim. no setup necessary. the extra ram is good. it runs pokemon go quite well but i doubt that will remain relevant at this rate. i am very pleased with this purchase. i went cheap and did not get burned. i got much more than i expected. get what u pay for i love this phone but the battery is terrible. unplug it in the morning and not even an hour later it\\'s down to 90% without even touching it. the battery dies by 3-4pm with minimal usage. other than that the phone is great product i returned it , it was locked because it was reported stolen. sprint the informed me the device will not work because it\\'s looked because it\\'s stolen item. this phone shut down and ask for a lock code. phone was only one month old. contacted vendor several times - nothing they sent work. its horrible, cause the phone was purchased for someone overseas. in order to bring it back and return would be costly. really awesome cell phone for right price brand new in book a s advertised everyrhing alright i bought this and after i started using it, it will completely shut off around 45%. so i\\'m not very happy with it because my iphone 5 did the same thing hence why i bought the 6s i love it (: it is the best phone ever nice and small excellent little phone. for the amazing low price i ordered three and will be ordering more since family and friends i gifted them to ,loved it.execellent back up phone and even daily use phone if you dont need a fancy smartphone been htc user for years now and this product is best htc i had. awesome screen, wonderful and warm colors with amoled display, what i loved about screen is it doesn\\'t fade in sunlight..!!! rear cam though is 13 pix but still lacks the punch, though which pro mode you can create amazing pics. front cam is best in any phone in this range or of higher range.and yes i opened the box got to phone out booted it, in few minutes alert for android 6.0.1 update and bammm got android upgrade within first few minutes of unboxing phone. now who can give you that amazing service love it htc..!!!yes the speakers a little disappointing but then hey its a new thing they are trying. let\\'s talk about earphone with boomsound and dolby enhance..with in box ear set you get crisp sound and wonderful bass, get a better earphone and damnnnnn it\\'s again one the best sound in any phone on this range, it just phenomenal..!!as for htc sense yes it\\'s as smooth as always and the phone is fast and reaction for apps to open is swift.so yes with price you pay, you get a phone which more worth than what you pay for. stop listening to people complaining about it looks like iphone, this htc device here is better than some brands flagship devices.hence think to further if you feel like having it click that add to cart button..!!! you wont regret 5 stars is not enough for a phone like this. i have had samsung changing to samsung was a huge leap. after some years of using smartphones, i love android and hate samsung. i think this is a great phone and i am glad i bought it. there are however a few things to keep in mind; these phones are refurbished, not new. and when they say: \"is certified to be 100% functional, and ready for activation\" what they mean is, as long as you already have a 4g sim card for it. i didn\\'t so i waited a few days to receive the sim card verizon sent me for free. i come from many years of iphone and wanted a mobile larger size than my last iphone iphone 5. i find the price of 6 plus totally crazy and i found in interet good references of this lg g3. first of all, i am delighted with android, that i find much more logical, intuitive and manageable than ios (not to mention the nightmare of itunes ....) and this lg g3 has exceeded my best expectations. i am very, very happy with my choice. delivery was on time. i recommend it. ok great phone for a good price, i was surprise when i reviced the phone its big and it works greats. love it, love it fantastic and i love it to the fullest...... i hope it will not crash or give me trouble in the near future? ok i bought a iphone 4s for verizon,off mbc mobile,it didn\\'t really say if it was new or used,but it came,very quickly,brand new in the box! everything included. i was worried because of some of the reviews,because i was just using it for tracfone,and so far everything is great! thanks! definitely recommend! everything ok. battery does not last. constantly shuts off. i wouldn\\'t buy another one. the samsung rugby 2 offered by wireless solutions arrived in 1 or 2 days, ahead of schedule. the product was new and in the original shipping container. bijan from wireless solutions indicated all their products were new, if stated as same on the amazon portal. the phone has worked without flaws thus far. the 3g capabilities provide reception in areas where signal quality is poor. the rugby 2 milspec design ensures durability yet in a light weight form factor. feature packed the rugby 2 when utliized on networks that allow sim card exchanges is the ideal world phone suited for use in a global communications environment. we applaude wireless solutions for providing a product with these capabilities. one call that does the job it is made to make calls, and manage emails in its purest level, thought i got a deal.speaker went out in three month.stopped charging in seven months,would never buy a blu again. buenas noches, me comunico con usted porque el telefono me llego, pero me pide un codigo de liberacion como es posible que yo compre algo que diga que esta liberado y cuando llega a venezuela se presenta este problema, por favor necesito soluciones love this phone. works great. excelente producto........... worse phone....ever!!!!!!!! so far so good, i was sent the xt1635-02, which is a dual sim brazilian version. runs smoothly and the battery is amazing. very nice phone. had some problems when it arrived. everything was in spanish. once got language straightened out. and got the correct size simm card, works great. love it. it is ok for what i needed it for. i needed something where i could quickly and easily set an alarm several time a day. this does the trick. i is a little bully for my taste but i can live with that. i have a fire phone and it does not recognize the software but since i did not get it for its smart watch function i am no to broke up about that. eventually i will get around to pairing it to one of my old iphones so i can play with it. so far so good! easy to operate. clear voice. high quality picture and great speed. all meet my need. why to spend 300 to 400 dollars for a piece of phone. when my friends heard the price and the size of phone, all feel my phone worth more than i paid. thanks for the device improve my life the output ratio - price are very good . it is much more than i expected cell phone. amazing piece of hardware couldn\\'t be happier the phone is just what i wanted buen celular works great. love this phone it\\'s worth the money bought 2 to take to greece. went to greece, bought two sims so we can call each other here. 200 mins and text time for 15 euros a sim. guy at the shop installed the sims and setup no problem. older model but works fine. very good phone for it price i received my phone today it the phone was in very good condition !!! love it!!! for the price of the phone was great and they through a car charger in i didnt even no about!!! blue dot is really good!!! thank you guys!!!! great phone, ultra fast and pure android experience.instant 5.1 upgrade the phone is way to slow for smartphone. it is sooooooooooo lag that i have to restart my phone everyday. not recommend for those who like to play game or surf web. it is super slow to carry out those functions. love this purchase just as much as the last one. very satisfied with the 4s - i use it on ting and my bill is 55 a month for two of us who use plenty of data, texts and minutes.easy to setup on ting. not unlocked, took it to at&t today to switch my sim card from my 5s to the new 6s plus....no go! super bummed out! so now i\\'ve gotta take it to the apple store, which is in the mall...i hate going to the mall...and hope that they can unlock the phone. i pray that they don\\'t tell me it\\'s a fake, like some of the other reviews i\\'ve read. this is a pain in the butt, will probably just end up returning the phone, thats how much i hate going to the mall. boo to false advertising! i loved it more than i expected it works very well here in venezuela with movistar excellent product can\\'t beat the value ... i was at an apple store to buy an unlocked iphone - the cheapest available (an outdated 4s) still would set you back $650+. yeah, right!it isn\\'t an iphone, but well built, fast, has dual sims, and comes with case and screen protector and absolute cool colors. btw, windows 8.1 works well and is stable & supports many foreign languages and keyboards. it also comes with windows office apps (powerpoint, word, excel) ... not all apps are quite yet on windows, but that\\'s a small compromise considering the overall value you are getting. very good and reliable smart phone. i\\'ve had my g3 for about a month and to be quite honest i consider this to be the best phone i\\'ve ever had. however that all changed this morning. the phone died overnight and when i woke up i put it to get a quick charge up ( using the official lg cable mind you) before i left for work. i got no response at all from the phone. the usual red led light indicating charging was not there, nor the usual screen with the battery charging that pops up when you put a switched off phone to charge. i\\'ve checked troubleshooting forums and gone through the usual hoopla and taken out the battery multiple times and such like, and still this has me frustrated. this was supposed to be a new phone...how can it have these serious issues only 1 month in.update...i would not recommend this seller to anyone. after quite some time of going around to independent phone repair organizations to no avail ( because the seller would not help me anyway) i finally returned the phone to lg uk. only to find out that i had been duped. while the phone had a pristine and wonderful looking exterior it was nothing more than a sham. the internals of the phone were nothing more than cheap knockoff chinese parts. so i was sold a crap phone by a dishonest company... this is infuriating!!! do not buy this phone!!! do not buy from this seller!!! have had nothing but problems with this phone. won\\'t charge so have to switch battery to another phone to charge. i love this model , but this phone is not good! love it this phone is great for gamers, i love it. this phone is at costa rica and works with ice simcardeste teléfono es genial, me encanta. este teléfono está en costa rica y funciona con el sim del ice too difficult to put in the battery. had to return it. meh its a 35.00 smartwatch it does what it says little cheap but it works as described i don\\'t like installing a non verified apk for my phone needs to be compatible with google wear from play store it said it was a 4g phone.... it\\'s not.... it\\'s so quiet you can\\'t hardly hear it when it rings or get a text. i just thought that polaroid would put out a better product. i feel that it was a waste of money! what a pity! i think this phone is perfect in every perspective except it got two major flaws making it impossible.heat control and battery life.it gets really hot if you run any app for 1 min or 2 and it won\\'t cool down for a long time and i didn\\'t run any big 3d games.battery life is ridiculously short.i left home 10am with a full charge,wifi on 4g or 3g network off,took about 20 pictures,listened music for like 2 hours,nothing else.it unbelievably ran out at 3pm!!!!!!and i don\\'t know if it\\'s common,receiver is not working good,i have to plug in earphone everytime i call somebody.returned it already. this phone is great...sleek design,nice keys,customizable display,cool ringtones...the only downfall is mms settings,can\\'t make it to work with t-mobile but internet works great and bluetooth as well...cool phone the phone came with nothing ..... it was fully charged though which gave me enough time too get a charger and headphones the phone had issues.first of all the upper part of the screen is discolored. when using earphones and charging or when using phone as a car ipod, the phone begins to make a loud deafening sound . the phone camera freezes too. all these continue until there\\'s a restart of the phone. which means you have to wait longer so far, so good, delivery was on time. product was as offered i love this phone looks & works like new the screen shattered in the first week, i have never had a cellphone break this easily. it did not have any tv function. could not get 4g speed excellent most of the retailers on this site are selling used phones advertised as new. i personally have done business with one retailer, cellphones-4u. the phone arrived in a verizon box, unsealed, loosely floating in a plastic tray, not an lg box as it should have been. you could tell the wall charger was extremely used and subsequently, didn\\'t work. immediate red flag. called verizon, gave them the meid# that is located inside the battery compartment. the lady told me that the phone had been used on the separate accounts. so it spent most of it\\'s life in shipment. cellphones-4u keeps insisting that it is new from verizon. he posted it under my bad review on their site. so, he is calling me and verizon liars. in hindsight, i noticed that every bad review that was posted for cellphones-4u, he had a reply that they were in essence, thieves or liars. do your homework. when you receive your phone, call your service provider, give them the meid# and find out if it is indeed a new phone. they are charging new price, make them provide what they advertise. i purchased the blu studio c mini, 4.7 last month and have enjoyed it without any issues. i am using it with my net10,no contract,unlimited plan and i\\'m very pleased with it\\'s look, feel and performance. i upgraded from an older model samsung smartphone and cannot understand what all the negative reviews are about. if you have been using or are using a high-end 400-600 dollar phone then that is what you should be comparing it to; not a 120 dollar phone. although, i will say that this 120.00 dollar blu smartphone far exceeded my expectations. the picture is clear and crisp and the quality is better than my old phone. the only minor complaint that i have about the phone is the speaker quality. the speaker does have a bit too much treble to it\\'s tone, but i was able to make equalizer adjustments through the \"play music\" player. i\\'ve enjoyed watching netflix movies with no lag time whatsoever. the only time i\\'ve noticed any lag was while watching some youtube videos, but i experienced the same lag on my laptop. before i even turned it on, i installed a 32gb mini sd card and have more than enough memory for the few apps and games that i prefer. my wife and i liked the phone so much that she also upgraded to the same phone in the orange color (nice and bright). like i said, it\\'s no high-end phone, but its an excellent buy for under 120.00 dollars. i highly recommend this phone. thanks amazon. perfect,except you need sd card from day one .the internal memory is low. excelente the screen gone black i will never order anything from focus electronics & appliances again. i received the item within a promise delivery time-frame, which is great. so i use the phone for about a week. everytime i make or receive call, the people on the other end told me that the conversation is breaking up and they cannot hear me. i had to switch my old blackberry. i called focus electronics & appliances, i stated the problem and the rep said it was my provider. i told her i have no reception problem with my blackberry. i told her i switch phone because couple keys on the blackberry is kind a stuck every now and then. she told me the blackberry is a better phone than the razor and i can return the item if i\\'m not happy with it. again, i told her it is not that i\\'m not happy, but the reception is terrible. so i return the phone and focus electronics & appliances only partially refunded me. they charged 20% for re-stocking fee and kept the s/h for a defective item that they sent to me. i filed a claim with amazon. amazon immediately refunded the difference that the merchant didn\\'t. amazone is a great company and i\\'ll continue to shop with amazon. but i will not buy anything from focus electronics & appliances. great product. this is my second blu phone and the only reason for update i ran out of memory space on old phone. i am still getting used to this phone but seems to be a good product for me. i use it for personal and business with a second phone app. i agree with some reviews the ring volume is not great but is workable. the screen and size are great speed seems good also not a lot of bloatware on phone. setup was pretty easy with google transfer of apps and contacts pretty pain free. all in all for price good phone. great phone! junk i\\'m hoping this time it will last,it is my 2nd time purchasing lumia,the ist time opnly lasted 3 mos. its the best phone i have used till now. large screen size, feasible to do a lot of stuff online without using a tablet. as soon i powered it on, it came up with jelly bean update. touch is good & very sensitive. but it does have some cons too check them out.pros:1. latest andriod, instant update to jelly bean.2. large screen, good enough for browsing, watching vidoes, playing games.cons :1. hardware is weak. couple of the apps get terminated abruptly.2. cam is not good enough.3. battery. a full charge doesnt get me a day.4. low sound in speaker phone mode. pretty great phone. it had some flaws but it worked great overall so nice excelent phone great condition! great phone. good phone and economy bought this as a gift for my hubby. he loves it and never goes anywhere without it. it works fine with his network (outside of the us) and it\\'s been quite reliable and useful in keeping us connected between countries. it\\'s a beautiful phone with so many awesome capabilities and the price was great. great i had had this before but lost it, now i bought this international version hoping for it to work in central america and it did marvelously right out the box. double sim capability and a faster processing due to the lack of the typical stuff phone companies pre install to their own phones. i\\'m in love with my big samsung galaxy grand 2 all over again. oh and if you want to install kit kat it works really good. bad quality product great phone at good price!! would not honor their warranty. a lot of people that i encouraged to purchase the phone had similar issues with the charging element in the phone. so far so good . i like this cell phone. i love it - larger words with extra apps. i don\\'t use all of them but just few to keep me doing what i needed. this is a cool item. finds bluetooth devices easily. there are some features which i have not figured out how to use yet, but hope learn through a dedicated forum if i can find one i specifically want to be able to control ipod camera from watch such as when ipod mounted to bicycle handle bars. according to expectations, very good article nice big screen. works 100% as advertised. 5 stars not what i had expected. has hole in the back for the apple symbol. i was expecting higher grade with a complete full wrap around. it\\'s ok,but doesn\\'t have instructions i like this phone. i purchased it as an upgrade to my lumia 635 after the last firmware update was unable to smoothly run on it. everything that was good about the 635 is good about the 435. the orange plastic came broken unable to use it this is a very functional small iphone; easy to carry, microphone and speakers provide adequate volume. i like the jitterbug. i like that it has a dial tone when it\\'s turned on and the sound quality is excellent. it is very easy to use. the only complaint is that the minutes don\\'t roll over month to month. if you don\\'t use them they expire. after going through 5 phones for my mother who constantly got frustrated because they were too difficult to deal with i found her this gem! it has a great camera, she can see the numbers, she loves that she can see the pictures on the full screen and can text with ease. i highly recommend this phone for the not so saavy tech people. i\\'ve had this phone a while now and in still so glad i bought this. the quality is so impressive and for so much less than the. samsung it replaced. loved it so much i bought my daughter one, she raves about it and has had many of her friends inquire about hers. i\\'m sure these phones will sell themselves when. people realize the value. thanks data does not work after hours of talking with att on phone for apn settingsclock resets when changing sim.very quite cant hear even when on loud with headphones or notno smart sync bluetooth --- cant pair to headphones a good phone and very useful. programmable to a new number. met my expectations entirely and completely. would recommend it phone is too fragile looking- size is too small. tendency to drop it but it\\'s a nice looking phone. instructions are in diff language & not in english. will be returning the phone. i purchased this item as an anniversary present for my husband and he is so in love with it. although he is not \"smart phone\" inclined he is really enjoying learning all the features. i am truly pleased. as for the product it works well, no complaints in that department. great inexpensive phone! this was delivered way sooner than expected! and works perfectly! the phone froze on blu logo and there has not come not even two months hard as i can haver ahhh this phone sucks! even bought a new 32gb sd card, and it wouldn\\'t download any apps! no gps, i got a new phone with-in a week of buying this phone. never again will i buy a cell phone off amazon, or the brand blu !!! delivers what it promises. buyer venezuela as espected, 100% recommed. aceptable execelente equipo. todo llego en buen estado. funciona aqui en venezuela con las tres operadoras. compacto, resistente y manejable.otro gran telefono de nokia. never go with this product. was working fine for a couple of months and stopped working. excellent phone! battery has given me 4 days of continuous use without charging and with all features enabled.functional,attractive-----well worth the price.highly recommended! to be honest, this iphone 6s plus 128g looks like a new one. for the price it\\'s a good buy. works 85% of time. other times cant make a call or even text. contacted company they wante me to upgrade. sounds suspious to me. send me phone that doesnt work and then want me to spend more money to upgrade. beware my son loves this phone! research in motion got it right this time, moving from a storm 2, i think this is the real deal and at that price -yes maybe even a better deal. i like the sensitivity of the touch not even the iphone has that.highly reccomendable great product, as we\\'ve come to expect from otterbox. this is my firts blackberry and i love it soo much the color is great it fit perfect in your hands love my phone! fast shipping! thanks! excellent it was a little late they said something and the package was here not the date they said so! this little thing has almost everything the siii has and works just as well. samsung has made very good products and this is not the exemption. would recommend to anyone. it\\'s soo nice i love it bought this to use when traveling internationally .. works well and is a great travel phone .. pop in a local sim and your good to go the simpler the better. no problem at all with this phone. excellent i did not receive my headphone jack when i received this phone, i took it to my cell phone provider to have a sim card put in it. the sim card would not work because the phone had been reported as stolen. awesome had to send the first phone back. and now the second phone freezes and force closes. it work very good. thank you. i love lumia 920 <3 i am impressed with the quality of this phone,the xperia z5 display excellent color reproduction and sharpness, has an excellent image, the glass screen feels sturdy, the software and hardware environment respond quickly and smooth, i have been using continuously and has no overheating by the continued use of streaming as z3,the xperia z5 is very well put together, with gorilla glass 4 on the front and back, an aluminum frame and rubber bumpers on the corners to help absorb shock if the phone is dropped,the camera has truly excellent auto-focus,regarding the battery of sony phone i do not see a big difference compared to other phones like samsung or iphone s6,but the biggest departure in design terms, is the look of the power button. sony’s trademark protruding chrome-effect circle, which has been around for years, has now been replaced by an elongated lozenge, slightly inset from the edge to prevent you accidentally pressing it.i particularly recommend this phone to a friend. excelente was. exactly what i was looking for . exelente great product, good delivery time line. like radio but did not work with iwirless this case is very efficient. not to mention, i like the pretty colors. i lost it. item received in the expected conditions. love my new phone actually no i am very unsatisfied with this because for it being a certified like-new product the charge port does not work properly i have only been able to use the standard slow charging charger because the fast charger does not work unless you apply slight pressure on the charger plug going into the phone up word which is not cool to me because it can damage the phone i plan on sending it back in to have it replaced for a better operational phone 25 days later and about a week of actual use/activation the phone completely dies when inserting an sd card. it detected it than immediately powered down, i\\'ll change the review if i can get it to power on but for now this phone appears to be rather poorly made. can\\'t set phone to buss and let you know there is a call and then speak on phone you have to talk on watch other parts work fine i\\'ve had several issues with non contract phones (i have to replace my droid as my cell plan isn\\'t eligible for an upgrade yet) and i didn\\'t have a lot of hope in finding something under $200. this phone is small, light weight and has great screen quality. it was easy to activate, configure, and nothing hangs or force closes. one thing to note...the screen is smaller than most smart phones. a lot of landscape is occupied with numerous buttons and frames but they don\\'t detract from the general usefulness. overall, this is a quality, affordable phone. recommend! not bad for the cost. works fine but the speaker is not to clear. is is not unlocked great for the price; second one i\\'ve purchased for a son who needs only basic functions. phone is simple to use, audio is very clear. the only drawback is battery life. it has to be charged every day. too small phone i ordered the iphone 6s plus, but get the iphone 6s. love my phone. this phone has everything i need. it has a powerful 16 mp camera that any phone could envy; i almost think sometimes that it will take x-rays instead of pictures, because of the balancing provided by its sensors. the quantum display shows its very fine quality on every picture or video. the phone practically functions with all the service providers worldwide. my problems with installing apk\\'s have finished thanks to its big 32 gb (the lggus991-32gb). i only would like that in this spectacular phone, the fm radio works, but isn\\'t the fact. i\\'m still delighted with it. when the perfect phone appears, i will hate mine, but until then i still love it!!! i bought this phone used and it has just been great.ma texas has worked perfectly since i bought it (about a year and a half?) and still does. a very good company to buy from. this is not new used scrtch ,bad box excellent love the phone nice although the phone arrived locked, the seller replied to my message within one day with the unlock code. the phone is otherwise perfect and exactly as described, 4g works without a hitch in australia.amazing build quality as always from nokia/microsoft, price and the chipset aside it truly feels like a premium flagship but luckily the windows os is very light and speedy so it doesn\\'t need the overbearing cpu power and ram that android devices need to run smoothly. the camera is an absolute joy in good and bad light. color reproduction is spot on and very vibrant. zero complaint about the phone, i could care less about the congested app store on android and ios. i just want a simplistic, solid, premium phone and this is just that.the seller was breed, very well mannered and despite needing one more day to get the phone unlocked, i really appreciate how quickly resolved the issue for me. i would buy from them again for sure but in the future i think it would be better if you guys just shipped the unlock code! excelente!!! got phone on time and worked perfectly. excellent phone! excellent great iphone for a very good price great price, middling phone. awsome phone till crackhead stole it i did not like this product. after putting the case on my phone i could not hear and the people i called could not hear me. what is the purpose of the phone if i can\\'t the person on the other end. i get that the box was designed to keep weather out but damn if you can\\'t us the phone what good is the product. excellent very good i had this phone for like 3 weeks now. couldn\\'t get it to connect to metropcs, went in the office the guy there said that i will have problems with it. anyhow i bought the sim card online from metropcs, call the customer service and get it to connect. since using it is a descent phone got no problem with my carrier like what the guy said in the store.. my only prob was the apn settings.. great phone for the price. loving what i am getting from it.. would recommend it... nothing to regret love it sooooooooo much\\' i refuse to pay the high prices for other well known phones. i love this phone. no problems so far. mine is a pretty orange, and is definitely me. has been fun learning all the neat features. got this phone and i am completely happy.works just as described.having no problems whatsoever and am able to blaze thru the web on it and download and do whatever i choose.very nice it\\'s perfect everything as expected, the description readed in reviews and on samsung webpage, are pretty acurrate. excelente the phone looks brand new, works just like a brand new phone. it came super early and i was very satisfied! thank you! the product does not hold a charge as well as other units i have purchased. excelent a lot of storage is used up on software when purchased. some glitches with suddenly turning on and off. overall functional. much better than windows phone, but i have no doubt that my next phone will be better battery doesn\\'t last more than 2 hours, it goes from 50% to 10% in a minute otter case = checkblack = checka+ fantastic works well. great price. unlocked and dual sim. i bought two phones the same exact ones , and so far i\\'m in love w. it ! it came perfect in good condition camera works great everything works great excelente telefono i like it i love this phone i like almost everything about this phone - it looks nice, has a useful physical keyboard, easy to use / figure out, and has good call quality.something about the size or weight of the phone makes it a bit awkward for me to hold at times, and thus i\\'ve dropped it more than any other phone i\\'ve had to-date. i had a bb bold before this which was heavier, had narrower sides, but was fatter in depth and it felt great in my hands and was rarely dropped.also, after a few months of use, the \"t\" became very sensitive causing multiple \"t\"s to generate with normal pressure. apparently, this is an issue many bb 10 users have. so far i\\'m not bothered enough by it to do something about it.finally, i\\'ve come across two folks who looked at this phone as if they\\'d discovered dinosaur bones in their backyard. they couldn\\'t believe people \"still used blackberries with keyboards\" although both admitted it is a smart looking phone. i received this today (yay for prime!) and i was frustrated at first. this is a standalone smart watch, not meant to be a companion to a smart phone. i couldn\\'t get my sim card to register with the watch. the slot for the sim card is huge, at least it\\'s huge for my microsd sim card. the manual is in chinese and english. it\\'s a tiny manual and the illustrations are even tinier. i inserted my sim card the way it showed in the illustration, and it didn\\'t work. i finally was able to maneuver it into a position that allows it to work. i\\'m still learning how to work the watch, but it is handy if you need your phone but don\\'t want to carry a bulky one. one thing i would suggest is ordering a larger sdhc memory card. the 4gb memory card that is included is not enough by far. also, the camera is positioned in a way where the only good part is that you can be sneaky with it. for those that like to take selfies and us-ies, the camera on this watch won\\'t help you. overall, it\\'s a good smart watch so far. good! hate it. hate it.hate it. i didn\\'t realize how annoying the lockscreen ads would be. i\\'ll be trading it in for a phone without the ads as soon as i can. yuck! nice and small the lcd dead don\\'t buy this phone, you can use it 1 month, after 1 month it turn off blackberry 9105v5.0.0.629 (gprs, wifi)not working:gpspinnot refreshing or updating:host routing tablenot able to download:app world the best camera in a mobile phone good product, fast. nothing to complain difficult to navigate, touch screen is very \"touchy\" - difficult to get to respond easily. worst of all after just over 6 months of little use the battery won\\'t charge correctly. every time we try to charge it it states to make sure we have the correct charger connected even though we are using the one that came with the phone. this is a poorly designed phone from top to bottom. after 6 months of trying to adapt we have given up and are buying another phone. that\\'s ok, a good piece, grand seller this has been a good phone for the money. the camera isn\\'t very good to be a 13 meg pixel because it just doesn\\'t take that good a picture. the phone has locked up constantly since we received it. it has not worked properly. these work almost exactly as described - the app to make the watch fully functional with a htc one will not download after scanning the qr code. with that being said - through the bluetooth connection you can make & receive calls, play music (although the speaker is on the quiet side) and take pics & send them to the phone via bluetooth. these were gifts for preteen boys and they could not be happier with them. they do really everything they wanted and i would consider them a great starter smart watch especially the small price tag. also the band is very sturdy and secure - which was an important feature to me. it\\'s beautiful, easy to use and so fast!. microsoft do the best work with the os and nokia with the phone. only two issues: first: at the time i received it in my country (venezuela), four months later (thanks libertyexpress), i need to update the phone 5 times (3 updates for windows phone, two for nokia - lumia amber and black) to get the best experience. that was so easy. and second: it has the at&t logo, but it\\'s okay, it\\'s unlocked.finally, i have a smartphone that covers all my mobile needs. i have a powerful camera (perhaps no more powerful than the lumia 1020) and now i have a very good reason to celebrate, since i came back to buy one of the nokia\\'s best masterpieces. awesome phone. great quality, good graphics and looks. i will say it\\'s quality outstand the price you will pay. this is great! i love it! the phone arrived as expected, so far is working just fine. i love xperia style and this phone looks and feels great very poor quality, it doesn\\'t work or function when the mini sd card is inserted, i still can use it for time keeping otherwise i would rather have not buying it good phone i love my new phone! so glad i read the revirws snd devifef on this one vs the samsung galaxy s5.dhhont get me wrong, i loved my samsung galaxy but this phone is the best!!!!!! all the functions if the sasumg but i have $400 extra in my pocket now beautiful and working good it is a excellent phone i like it becouse the price is razonable i bought this phone because i didnt want to pay the price of an iphone.now, after a few months of use, the phone is goung crazy...it keeps shutting down when i whatching any video or trying to take a picture or even playing a game like candy crush or smth... it doenst matter how full the battery is...sometimes i have over 90% and it still shuts down. for two times now it also happened that it restarts non stop. and nothing i can do to stops it from restarting. it keeps restarting untill the battery dies. fast delivery and works good. i love ths phone...i got it because i had a samsung galaxy s6 with 32g and no removable battery....and i hate that...so i swich to lg....and got the awesome lg v10....i\\'m very impressed. and that\\'s coming from a guy that is a samsung lover....i had a an s3, s4, s5, s6....and i waited for the s7...and it finally came out and we\\'ll it let me very desapointed..not much different that my s6....so that\\'s why i have a v10..love the 5.7 inch screen...great resolution....and something that i love in the samsung and don\\'t have it any more....it\\'s the removable battery and the option of adding more memory....i ran out of memory on my s6...and we\\'ll had to let go of samsung for good...now lg will be my number one phone for me...the lg v10 is a big phone not for everyone....for someone with big had like me will enjoy this phone a lot... little brother\\'s first phone.the price point is perfect for the performance it provides, and adds some peace of mind. it\\'s not an expensive phone, so it\\'s not like he\\'s playing around with $600-700. the android experience on it is pretty clean overall, and i can tell he\\'s pretty comfortable with it. i love this phone. personally, i like my mobile phones to be mobile. i don\\'t want to look like i\\'m talking to a graphing calculator. it\\'s fast, has a great camera, and fits in all my pockets. it\\'s an older model and very affordable. so i didn\\'t expect much as for computing performace. it\\'s a bit slow but the better more efficient apps like google or gmail or mymail works great.for phone calls you have to place the tip of the phone on your ear, which i didn\\'t know at first and couldn\\'t hear very well. but once i figured it out i heard fine.i bought it as a travel phone, and got it for the battery life. battery life is very good. i have used anything that lasted this long so it\\'s hard to compare, but this phone should be my benchmark for long lasting phones from now on.it lasts me about 2 days. i use mostly mymail, google, yelp, facebook, google maps for driving navigation, and expedia as apps. all in all, it\\'s a great travel phone for the money. excelente it\\'s not a real lg g3. after a quick examination with a real g3 we notice that it was a knock-off. it does not work very well. i bought his phone for an upgrade after i got tired of my iphone 5. they are in great condition good phone, slipped the att sim card and off it went! no complaints, great reception for voice calls, typing is easy,text messaging a breeze. smart phone nope! great call quality and competent texting phone, definitely! do the math, and take into account the att $36.00 activation when you get that \"free\" upgrade, which includes a new 2 year contract at the higher subsidized monthly rate, before you have to sharpen your pencil you will realize this phone paid for itself in under 3 months! don\\'t hesitate to recommend it highly if this is what you are in the market for. excelente i too received an opened phone in a package that had an opened seal which stated: do not accept if seal is broken.in talking to amazon customer service, they fairly easily facilitatd a return...but that is a huge pain in the neck, having to now wait to get another phone.in speaking to blutekusa, i was told that this has been a continual problem with amazon. blutekusa feels that amazon is sending out returned, used phones as new. blutekusa claims that they have tried to remedy the problem with amazon, but have had not response and actually have difficulty contacting amazon.if the above is true, i would say: amazon, clean up your act. samsung has lived up to there standard giving great service. perfect even though this is a simple slider phone, it is exactly what my wife wanted and she loves it. would buy again. amazing phone the best smartphone ever was well loved, but developed issues over time. the screen started to show some discoloration with the pixels, couldn\\'t connect to bluetooth and had trouble with the battery staying charged. other than those issues, phone worked well. excellent cel, really nice photos. like the new design. phone is ok but touch is not working properly my brother was happy... got it for him for christmas.. better than any other phone he has gotten.. very satisfied! thank you!!! very very good in less than a year no power due to software problems .irrecoverable im blown away at how amazing a phone thats this old is! i came from an iphone 4 that i got at the beginning of the year and im never going back! this is my first htc phone and i freacking love it! its fast, the screen is amazing quality, and it truly is incredible! this is a great little phone. one big star off for non-instructive directions. they say what you can do, but not how to do it. i nearly broke the darn thing trying to lift the sim card slot the same way the memory card slot lifts to load. i may have broken the 2nd sim card slot, but i don\\'t know how to check. i wonder if i can just put sim card 1 in the # 2 slot to test? i think now that you aren\\'t supposed to lift the sim card slot, just slide it under the bar. instructions would have helped. other than that, it is a great, simple little phone, especially for older folks that don\\'t want or need a smartphone. and the battery is amazing. i haven\\'t used it much, but the stand-by battery is awesome. i charged it once when i got a couple of weeks ago and the charge is still full. great phone for a little peace of mind. great product for the price it\\'s a decent phone. the dual sim capability is cool it\\'s like having two phones in one. it is unlocked but pending where your location is will tell how the phone acts on the carrier. the not so good is the camera. out of focus and dull. not the best. also it restarts out of the blue for some reason but for the price and what\\'s all included it\\'s not a bad phone. if you\\'ve got the patience for windows 8 then go for it. patience is a virtue with this phone sometimes the battery madden but in general it s a great cell phone i bought this to replace my husband\\'s blackberry storm he lost in the airport. he is so please with it\\'s sleek design. he likes it a lot. so easy to use and surf the web too. a perfect little thing specially for a busy, always-on-the-go and not gadget freak person like him. this phone was an upgrade from the first galaxy and is much better. the activation process was easy and well documented. i am very satisfied with this upgrade. i didn\\'t want to have to spend a ton of money and didn\\'t need a lot of features. for the price this so far has been an excellent choice. i purchased this for my son to use and it was a great buy for the price. the charger didnt work, i suppose that it meant to work on china, and the language is on chinese too, not so hard to change to english though, the cellphone excelent! the main touch button give hard time to switch page/screen.when i read the review about this i phone• apple iphone 4s 32gb white - unlocked by apple• used, very good• in stock• shipped from: mobilespree• gift options not available. learn more excellent! !!! great product considering the price vs quality it was a stolen phone very dissatisfied i didn\\'t like the idea that the watch is having a camera edit: i\\'ve had some problems with the screen becoming disconnected from the rest of the phone which makes it turn off randomly at some times. i\\'ve had to take it to get it fixed, which cost about $65 and i\\'m disappointed because besides that it has been working fine. i\\'m having the same problem again now, possibly due to me dropping it (whoops) but i wish there was a way i could get it fixed for free through a warranty.--------------------the unlocked galaxy s5 works like new! i\\'m able to use tracfone with it which saves me a lot of money. so far i haven\\'t had any problems with it, although the only small complaint that i have is that the charger port cover does not snap in properly, but it can still stay closed so it\\'s not really a problem. overall i\\'d definitely recommend this!! an excellent simple slider phone for someone who just wants to call and text. has large enough numbers to read and use. has capability of having an outdoor ring that is very loud. i love this phone. my last three phones have been this phone. the last two phones played out because they got water damage. i bought this phone for my sister n law and she loves it. nice phone for the price! amazing the phone is for my brother, it is very beautibul, but is big even for him, but it is a good phone for the price worth it. i am absolutely inlove with this phone. the battery life is more than 24hrs after using it constantly, it does not overheat, both cameras are perfecttttt.. i am inlove with the front flash. honestly i\\'ve had a lot of samsung phones and this is a perfect choice.. i love it.. it\\'s amazing.. battery runs out instantly once it reaches 40% - 30%. time is reset once battery drains to 0%. the camera is of horrible quality - does not focus well and does poorly in low light conditions. otherwise ok so far. great cell phone. well built. i like the versatility of having both gsm and cdma in the phone. item is hanging off and not every time that happens; what was not expecting, because i do not like the system does not operate your phone died after 3 1/2 months. lost all my pictures. truly disappointing excellent! the blackberry 8520 is a versatile, easy to use and very powerful smartphone.i bought it for my 14 year old daughter, and she is very happy with this phone.our family members are blackberry fans, and one of the things we love is the blackberry messenger which allows us to communicate easily and at no additional cost. muy buen cel me llego en perfecto estado funciona al 100 % con movilnet y le vanta el 3g recomendado 10 puntos not a good choice at all. son liked that it was so small but he dropped it once and the screen has black lines thru it. seems very cheaply made. even though it\\'s small i still expected decent quality. product was purchased on aug 3, 2016 it is now november 9 and the phone fails to charge. replaced the battery and no power. i used other phones and each battery work. i was respectfully refunded the amount originally spent on phone the microphone was not working at all. couldnt use ir before and now i found it out. never buy something used form amazon!!!!!! it is a scam i still have alot to learn about this phone but so far it is good. especially when it enables me to access so many of these apps for free in customizing my phone, the picture quality is great. love my lg g3 d855 like new! works great! fast shipping! thanks!!! i love it! it is everything i expected it to be! authentic packaging and all the little details that normally count were there, including a holster. everything was great, shipment was super express! very good phone. i highly recommend it for interested buyers purchased this item and it doesn\\'t recognize my sim card. great phone. comes with all the tools you would ever need and of course there are tons of apps to choose from. large, sleek, fast and fun. excellent very good the recommended product the product and the seller i don\\'t think this phone was brand new. if it was new then i was one of the unlucky ones to get a bad phone that heats up with very little use and discharges too quick. not satisfied. i should have considered all he bad reviews and not have gotten a sony xperia . ok daughter is very happy and that says it allll. i asked amazon if i can use this phone in japan, and i got an answer \"yes\". unfortunately i could not use this phone in japan. too bad.good size screen, but typing is not easy. not very sensitive to the touch. also a little slow. this phone hasn\\'t given me any problems! it\\'s practically brand new! great buy!! very good product, recommended surely works perfectly, i have no complaints or the product or the seller. brought complete accessories all really very safe it\\'sn a powerfull phone. battery life is a little short i return to what i know and i\\'m comfortable with. thank you for a quality product. todo exelente, tal cual como lo describio el vendedor, exelente telefono... nuevo y liberado. 100 % recomendado en la comunidad great quality nice phone. super cool case keeps my tablet safe, way easier to grip now. i pulled out the screen protector cause it made the screen look bad and the feel was poor. the cover plate /stand is a cool addition. very well made product delivered as promised in a timely manner at this point, i have nothing to complain about. granted, i\\'ve only had it for a month, but i love everything about it. it\\'s fast, has plenty of memory for me, and it was really well priced. i bought three phones. they are excellent. thanks to an honest carrier employee, i was pointed to the internet to get a replacement phone for mine that had a disappearing screen. i found the exact same model, in a new phone, for a price much more reasonable than the carrier could have ever provided. the ordering and shipping process was fast and clean. and i am quite satisfied with the purchase, and with the vendor. excellent scrath product, es usado no nuevo!! excelente producto a un buen precio, se recibió de forma rápida y eficiente recomiendo a este vendedor al 100%, el teléfono llegó a mis manos en perfectas condiciones. i was unaware that verizon isn\\'t gsm compatible, i liked the phone but was unable to use it. how do i return it? very good! got it as a gift for father\\'s day for my dad, it\\'s great! he loves it and wears it everyday. user friendly. it started off ok, but now it locks up. maybe a drop of water got in the usb port (right side), but the button is now locked out within minutes of starting. pretty much a writeoff. muy buen producto!!!, tal como lo quería, completo y con todo lo que decía la publicidad. me funciono perfecto con mi compañía de telefonía local en venezuela. the phone is a gift. they arrange that i pay the bill and the user never sees the bill.they worked with me and the the new user is finding the phone very easy to use. the phone worked great for under a year and then the antenna broke and i couldn\\'t get a signal from the cellular network anymore. niiiiice. it was ok...!!!!! cheaply made. the power button broke and now i can\\'t turn it on it seems that there are many posable outcomes when buying from this seller, because i checked the reviews before buying and found many more positive than negative but i have to say, this phone did not deliver. it was not 4g capable, which apparently is a quality of factory unlocked phones however this was not explained and was a big let down. secondly the battery literally lasted for 23 min, i\\'m not sure why because since it was new one would think that it would function as well as any other blackberry but it would over heat and then die literally in 23 min.lastly and most importantly, it did not ever find a network connection, with t-mobil or at&t, it was not branded but the start up screen was some company i had never heard of. all in all, my experience was terrible and all i can hope is that they let me return it for a full refund. i have received my samsung galaxy s7 g935f satisfactorily, ngp store you are the best! thank you for the order. i will have present you for make more purchases in the future. its performance is not the best now but still works very well. its an amazing phone and i love it this was one of the crappiest phones i\\'ve ever purchased, if i could give no stars that\\'s what it would be.....my phone (which i mean this one) was recently stolen from my job. and i\\'ve yet to contact the seller for a replacement , my response to it being stolen was ha ha, the joke is on them! this phone froze up on me more times then i can count! it have even cut off on it\\'s own , or has taken long to cut back on, the camera is some crap!!!!! and here i was thinking that oh since it was a \"polaroid\" brand then the camera would or should be great! no.....no, that certainly wasn\\'t the case, the only thing i\\'m mad about with my phone being stolen is that my memory card and sim card is gone to! working well after two months no complaints at all the number button are not working properly this refurbished phone was a piece of junk. had to use speaker to talk to people and the home button didn\\'t work. great product i love love love this phone,going to buy another one.you cand bet the price. good. came apart after 90 days just only one fall and broke the screen, not recommend! my issue is with specific vendor that sold me mine, not with blackberry or amazon. on receipt of this phone, i find out it is clearly an at&t branded variant version of the priv that is not unlocked. rather, the instructions to unlock it and use with any gsm carrier are included with the phone. also included are a page full of printed instructions telling you over and over that if you are unable to unlock this phone, per the instructions, then it\\'s basically all on you - no refunds, exchanges, etc. this is not a oem factory unlocked blackberry version. that it is an at&t variant is unclear in the item description as written, and is not revealed until you open the phone after delivery and see it in the at&t box with the at&t logo on the back of the phone. i thought, and everything on the posting indicated, that i was purchasing a blackberry factory unlocked, unbranded priv. very disappointed... returned. phone specifications do not correspond to the offered shipping was very fast. phone has minor scratches but nothing noticeable. all in all 5 starts!!! got this phone a few days ago and it was in perfect condition ! i went yesterday and hooked it up to tmobile . this phone is perfect no flaws at all. the seller is awesome as well and even checked in with me after the phone was delievered to make sure i was happy! thank you so much . amazing phone. i love how fast it is. i would buy 100 times over. yes i just purchased this product and i am highly satisfied 5stars i would like it to give me a direct link to address book like my old nokia. but otherwise it is good. exellent it disconnects with no warning and no reason. the phone can right beside of the watch and it will still disconnect pro:everything (i had a nexus 5 and it was jut pain with signal and quality. my nexus 5 bent)- aluminum housing- fast and furious- hanged only 1 time so far in 3 months (mutiple calls, fb, whatsapp, etc)- nexus 5 killercons:- whoever was the camera engineer should be fired. my 5 year old digi cam takes better quality pictures in dark.- in low light camera is like a day without a laugh (useless) finally! an android 5.0 phone that works with android auto.update 12/07/15:disappointing that the supposed \"flagship\" does not support voice dialing on it\\'s own. i know, you can use google, but shouldn\\'t blu have put it into this model. several reviews seem to think it does have this function, but customer support says no.no promise of os upgrades per cs either. another of blu\\'s issues, especially on it\\'s flagship model. excellent product all ok this product sucks i buyed a month ago and is not working the internal memory stop working and doesn\\'t have warranty i have to drop in the trash don\\'t buy this cellphone please the phone works fine but wont hold charge the battery drain very fast, i fully charged night before in the morning the battery only has%30 .it has also over heat problem. everything is as it says, $g s5 sm-g900f unlocked, all new and in perfect conditions, so happy with the smartphone the phone itself was fine, but it verizon wasn\\'t able to set up service on it. perfect... i am a late adopter. i am such a late adopter that i don\\'t have a data plan but jump from wi-fi to wi-fi spot. i need a phone with solid hardware and simple tasks like listen to podcast. the phone battery needs to be charged daily. my ex blu phone needed charging every 3 days. most of the battery energy is consumed by google play services which i don\\'t use often ( no data plan ) but oh well. is my first oled phone so i\\'m impressed with the graphics. the mechanics of this phone are pleasant ( weight, size, responsiveness ). put the chip in, turned it on and it is done. it is running since then. no issues. the person i gave it i svery happy with the large keys. nice disposable phone for the price. excelente great gadget. being unlocked works like a charm with any cell provider. hotspot function is a major plus. love it. this is a great phone. so far is amazing, fast, awesome screen. i haven\\'t try the unlocked since i need new sim card, now it uses the nano simple card, but i\\'m expecting to work. i bought this used and i was really nervous because it was such a huge purchase. nextdaytech really took care of me. props to them. the phone is exactly like they described and they gave me a wall adaptor and charger breaks down very fast the cell phone but they send to me has a 9gb of internal memory and the cell phone i liked it is the 16gb gracia thank you two weeks after receiving my moto g4 plus, the device will shut off at random. by shut off, i mean the screen goes completely black, and any sound that may have been playing while listening to music or watching a video cuts out as well. this happens regardless of how much of a charge the phone has, and may even occur while plugged in and charging. i have power cycled the device, cleared the cache partition, and tried booting up in safety mode to no avail. having owned a moto g 2nd & 3rd generation, in addition to a nexus 6, i am extremely disappointed. i don\\'t believe it is just a coincidence that after lenovo purchased motorola and began to slowly phase out the motorola name that i buy this latest model and have such trouble with it. i am very satisfied with this phone, good phone for this price and i would give a thumbs up to anyone who is thinking of getting a great phone for a reasonable price. it\\'s excellent product came exactly as described and would recommend getting this if you like yourself a galaxy s3 and i would give this product a 5 star i\\'m not entirely sure where to begin. i\\'ve never left a review before so bear with me.i only need two simple things from a phone, battery life and reception. that\\'s all. i don\\'t need the internet. i don\\'t need twitter or facebook. in a world where smartphones are ever on the rise, i suppose i must be an oddity. now, i\\'ll admit, the need for a full qwerty keyboard is a recent one. i\\'ve managed, up until a few years ago, to never send a text and i\\'m well into my late thirties. i\\'ve never really seen the use of it all, myself. one leads to another and another when all it would have taken is a simple two minute phone call. of course, that was all before i got my current job and low and behold i was reborn a texter. i really do hope my boss is proud of herself.still, regardless of the new changes, some things remain a constant necessity. phones are first and foremost for making calls. as i don\\'t need the internet, nokia has always been my go to company. why buy a smartphone when it\\'s not needed? this is my fifth phone with nokia and i\\'m afraid to say that it will likely be my last. before i get to the simple whys, however, i wish to contradict myself for a moment. this is a marvelous device. the build quality is superb. you can tell nokia put a great deal of time with the building of the e6. the sturdy metal frame and the gorilla glass are testaments to that. and while some may groan and complain about symbian being outdated, to me it is still a reliable and dependable os.so, why will i be shortly listing this device on ebay you ask? i have two simple words for you, call quality. notice i don\\'t say reception. nokia still holds the reigns in that department in my humble opinion. and, in battery life too while we\\'re on the subject. i always got at least two days out my device and that was with heavy talking and texting. but, since the purchase of this phone, i\\'m consistently asked to repeat myself, often told that i\\'m difficult to hear and understand. these complaints have vanished recently as i\\'ve sadly moved, temporarily, to a blackberry bold. as i am on the front line for my company, often being it\\'s only face for our customers, this is unacceptable.sadly, nokia, i regret that we must part ways. i hope you\\'re able to turn things around for yourselves as, in my eyes, you\\'re still the best.a disappointed customer thanks for everything excelente beautiful, huge screen. all the apps you need now. lots of cool features but you may have to go on youtube and watch videos to learn them all. please notice, sprint only this phone has been nothing but trouble. i had to replace the battery twice within like 3 months, i finally gave up and spent more money on a different phone-- not worth it. product damaged the phone arrived on time and it worked as expected. very nice product and service. i\\'d recommend the article and the vendor. overall this phone is not for me. it has a few great features though. way to expensive for what you get.it is too small for me and i don\\'t like not being able to delete the apps i do not use.i suggest watching the videos on youtube before you buy one. my son loves the lg gr500 phone. it is affordable and meets his needs. it is brand new and cheaper than having a contract with a cell phone company which charges $100 to replace a cell phone. it gets shipped quickly and is unlocked so all i have to do is get a new sim card from my cell phone company which is free. phone is with sprint prepaid hi, thanks for your service and i\\'m questions i am happy with the purchase, excellent product. item met my expectations excellent and fast shipping i love this phone. bought it for my son in jamaica. i know he\\'s going to love it. i\\'ve send him pics. thank you perfect color - mineral blacki am transitioning from oneplus 3 to xperia xz. i am satisfied with the performance my current phone but i am making this shift to xz only for the design aspect and camera. i have been waiting so long for sony to release an all rounder phone that can compete with other flagships in the market and this time they nailed it.pros:performance: crisp and fast without any lag.design: imo, this is the best looking handset among the current flagships(including iphone 7 and pixel). it\\'s been 3 days since i started using it, and it had already drawn attention from my friends. in one word it will put all the flagships to shame. thumbs up for the mineral black color.camera: manual mode is a killer. auto focus and video quality is also good. indoor and low light shots are great if you can tweak little bit in the manual mode.fingerprint sensor: if you can spend some time and flash the software with uk version, then you will probably unearth one of the amazing and effective finger print sensors in the market. it seems to respond faster than iphone6s, iphone 7 and oneplus 3.display: nothing to complain.speakers: dual speaker are really cool.sd card: not yet installed a micro sd card. so could not comment on that yet.water proof: have not tested and no intentions to do it.cons:battery: its just satisfactory. i use my phone quite a bit during day(at least 2 hour talk time, 3 hours of listening music, 1 hour of bluetooth streaming in the car, 2 hours of browsing, social networking and video streaming combined). an extra 10% could have been better in my case.wish list:charging time: oneplus3 and pixel has fast charge option that can charge 60% of the phone in 30 mins. i miss that feature in xperia xz. it usually takes 60 minutes for 60% charge.overall: sony has finally hit the cord by packing all the best and cool features into one single handset xz. be it camera, display, performance, fingerprint sensor or dual speakers it perfected each of those features. price wise it is on the higher end of the spectrum competing with samsung and apple. sony is a premium brand which uses finest materials. it is perceived as an upscale brand even before apple started working on it\\'s ipods. at the same time i would not waste money if they deliver incompetent products(which is the case of some of their earlier xperias).but if a sony product can compete with samsung and apple then i would not mind paying the premium. if you don\\'t want to be one in millions using iphones and samsungs and yet do not compromise on quality and performance then the answer is \"own an xperia xz\". i am very happy i deal with you, the product is excellent good, its fine cell phone thanks you. i love my new phone. the phone has more problems then i thought. but came fast which i loved so a 7.5 out of 10 good product it was exactly as seller described and works beautifully ! could not be more leased with it , and a good price. good product, in description everything as this is. this is a great phone with affordable cost. i don\\'t mind the bloat wares as long as they help keep the cost down. just remove or ignore the bloat wares. i like the power and boost button that release unused memory instantly. it works great with official asus flip cover case. simply close cover to put into sleep and open cover to wake it up. (i don\\'t use the fingerprint security). there are flip cover cases by other manufacturers, but be aware that not all of them can make phone sleep/wake automatically. grrrrrr... the phone came...i wet to at&t...they said the phone was stolen... phone not activatible.... -100000 stars. muy buen producto it\\'s awsome. i love it :) i\\'ve owned this phone for 8 weeks and now it randomly restarts several times per day. and resetting all the customization. it\\'s worthless, especially when it happens when you are about to take a picture then lose the shot. service was good and fast, just not the product. best of the best. there is no question in my mind that microsoft leads now in innovation and design. i got my first lumia 520 as a temporary replacement for a malfunctioning iphone and it was love at the first sight. now i got this 640 xl, its mine not like an iphone or others and it is wonderfully designed, fast operating system and great battery life. ordered and came in less than 1 week. installed my microsim from att and it was running smoothly. the only issue was it came from china or hk and everything the screen instructions were in chinese...so i got in youtube and found a clip explaining how to change the language to english and with a little bit of imagination it took me a couple minutes to do it. the double sim card is going to be handy since we travel overseas and i am sick of att overpriced rates. by the way both cards appear to be \"active\" so i will be able to choose and pick on the go which phone number to use. another little issue is that the charger that came with the phone is a weird one ( i think i have seen this type in the uk) so i use another usb cable but it must be a thick one like my surface 3 otherwise there is a message that the charging process will be slow. by the way, no need of expensive cases unless you are prone to dropping things. the 640 xl fits perfectly in my jeans front pockets.so...it is a great phone and trust me..i am a recovering appleholic that still hangs to his ipad mini but now is sold to the idea that for now the future in technology and design is in microsoft.five stars because this phone is more that what i was expecting and now ai am ready for w10 great phone. 64gb of internal memory. 4gb of ram. it\\'s good specs wise but the phone heats up all the time. even doing the simplest of things like researching stuff on the internet to playing basic games. and when you play big games like clash of clans it just turns into a heater. i can feel the heat through my phone case. maybe it\\'s the thermal paste they used or something but it doesn\\'t work. other than the heating issue it is great. excelente it was a great device but the sound needs improving. to \"prepaid mobile partners\" who sold this product to me,i did send you three return requests in last two weeks. no response so far.it does not make any sense at all for you to sell this crappy phone that always shows the \"sim card error\" message. it doesn\\'t accept prepaid t-mobile or sprint sim cards. technically, i need to unlock it.so who did you sell this one to me. is the way you do your business?i want my money back!!!tj a gift for my wife & she is very happy with it!!! the phone is labeled \"new\" but it\\'s refurbished. it\\'s a second hand phone label as new! unbelievable! !! i wasn\\'t able to activate it since cricket changes systems a little short on memory (4gb) but windows mobile os doesn\\'t require much.compact budget phone that gets the job done without breaking the bank.as with any budget phone, a little slow for things like touch response, but overall dos aok.just temper your expectations - it\\'s not a galaxy s6 or a high end wp so don\\'t compare to one. nice for its price great phone so far. a physical booklet would have helped as opposed to getting online. so far it is fun to use. this is my second posh and my second smartphone. i upgraded because i wanted gps. my sister is going to take my old pegasus which is still functioning fine. i love my titan, definately a crisper display and camera, but most of all it is super fast. i have to get my data working on it though. i don\\'t think it is the phone, i think it is something with configuring and setting it up. had to do something special with the pegasus too to get it set up. chatting now with my carrier to see if they can help me. it is a very large screen, so i am going to gift my asus tablet to someone as i really don\\'t need it anymore. this phone is faster than my tablet. good product. great phone , loved it. it was all i was expecting from htc . great display, great audio , very fast and the best of all is that it has the best design of all android goooood iphone it came broken. battery is overheating. home button doesn\\'t work. it was a gift and it was sent far away so i can\\'t return it anymore. very disappointed! thaaaaaaaaaanx... i bought this phone for over six months for use in venezuela and until now i\\'m very happy with its performance: it is very easy to use, economical, quick internet connection and the battery lasts several days despite continuous use ... i give a rating of 5/5 ... thanks amazon and nokia .. j. briceño below $100. it is a steal. i have no complains. good it had a piece broken that was not on description. phone is great love it. and its pink:) good excellent quality product for the best price./..unlocked...hence can use with any carriers...very good bargain for the price its being offered.....very much recommended.. thank you for an excellent product. highly recommend this seller! excelente producto bought it for my mom shes very happy💋❤❤❤ works great. i love the phone!!! it\\'s light and a great size.👍 i got it in two days. super! great love it..sim card slot was too small but that\\'t something which could be fixed by cutting the simcard.....great phone i love it!!.....remember to charge the phone before using it! compre mi producto nuevo y me llego dañado no tiene señal con ninguna de las casas telefonicas de venezuela en todos lados me dicen que es el amplificador de señal y el producto es (nuevo) vert good excellent for the price. better than what i was expecting. runs smoothly, charges quickly, battery holds for 1.5-2 days. much better than my old nexus 4.the only missing feature is nfc. i\\'ve never used these feature in my old phone, anyway.it\\'s really slim, light and ofcourse gorgeous. 64gb of memory, 16 mp camera and fingerprint unlocking, all for $299.i would definitely buy it again and will look forward to the new versions. the g1s works for me in the us. will try it in france soon.but it might make sense to wait for the g2 model.....update: i have now tried it in france (paris and corsica) : works very well. awesome phone for the price. it meets all my needs! for anyone that doesn\\'t have to have the latest and greatest this is the phone you want to get. great product as good or better than original great battery, doesn\\'t annoy me with notifications, higher app quality than android. digitizer broke in my pocket. i weigh 140 lbs with a case on the phone. substandard construction makes it too flexible. tech supports says i can\\'t even have it fixed by the manufacturer. no change great little phone...... able to use for calls and texts while in cuba ...good buy i purchased this phone as a replacement phone for my son. works with my current verizon plan and i was able to connect with no problems. very happy with this phone. however, loses a star because of the overheating which sometimes causes the phone to shut off and factory reset. good solid case. the wallet portion can hold 2 of my cards easily. i like that door part of the wallet has the ability to hold a card or id. the included pocket mirror is a nice touch. perfect still i love my phone phone is great so far! no complaints. the charger, however- with my very first time plugging it in and unplugging, the whole top (thumb) part slid off lol. everything is pretty good other than that. thanks so much! this phone is not un-locked even though it was advertised like so. when i got the phone from amazon, there was small piece of paper inside telling the phone had been unlocked for me and to unlock it i was told to open the t-mobile app in the phone. i tried using that app to unlock, but it failed.called lg support - they told they would not be able to do it. called t-mobile support - they also told they would not be able to unlock it.now i don\\'t have any other option but to return the phone.so much wastage of time - hate it!!! i received it .. and everything works great bottom right of my screen doesn\\'t sense touch well at all. the phone has been freezing and lagging pretty badly. it has been a little over a month i believe so i don\\'t think i can return it, i may check with motorola however.the phone size is nice and you can play games without much of a problem. i am not a fan of the camera. with this phone, more pixels does not mean better quality. the quality is mediocre at best.the phone storage is expandable which is convenient if you like having music, videos, books, or audiobooks on your phone. the phone build feels lightweight, but it feels like a quality phone. i am frustrated however with the sudden freezes and lagging. i believe this is a good phone for the price, but i also believe motorola can do better than this! i specifically ordered an at&t phone but received a t mobile carrier phone. not cool at all. wife and i have been living with a flip phone for so long now, that batteries for it are more expensive than this phone. so we decided to upgrade and get a \\'smart\\' phone. our kids will be so surprised... that we can operate it that is.we have puretalk and took the sim card out of the old phone and into this one. i had to get puretalk to send a reset code out to my sim and then set 4g off on the phone, then it started to work. lots of apps to use immediately and more to just load this thing up.now that we know it\\'s a good match for us, i just placed an order for a second phone for my use.$50 for a phone and $15 a month for puretalk is all we pay in cell phone use. good phone for the price nothing to fancy just your basic smart phone with android os good shipped perfectly. using flawlessly for months on end. would suggest buying a sim card with it unless you live close to a spring store, i had to make three trips to get it working properly. however, that isn\\'t the buyer\\'s fault, sprint just has a s***ty way to do everything. 10/10 phone is very sleek and attractive. very light in the hands.. set up was a cakewalk.. android 5.0 preinstalled. pretty quick response time .. overall impressed with this phone. has gotten a little warm with heavy use but nothing extreme like noted in some of the other reviews, completely happy with my choice.. my last phone was a galaxy s4 active. so to still be impressed.. it says alot. i would so make the same decision again nice good very nicethanks so much bad camera, procesor is to hot, bad speakers, my phone was unlocked and had scratches shut down minutes after unboxing. won\\'t stay on for more than a few minutes. thank i have owned several unlocked phones, moto g, moto x, and a couple of others, this by far the best phone i have owned. it is very fast, has enough capacity, and is expandable via an sd card. some of the complaints i have read are about the emui interface, if you do not like it, just load the google now launcher from the google playstore and basically you have almost stock android phone.fingerprint reader is fast, camera is very good with advanced capabilities, battery life is excellent (full day) and some other cool features, like ir remote control, eye comfort mode, and ultra battery mode. this phone didn\\'t last me a week after purchasing. i had gotten it set up and been using it for a few days before it gave out, i never dropped it or got it wet, i simply let it die once and it never turned back on. i tried everything, and even found complaints of the same problem online, i finally gave up. i pull it out every now and then to see if it will charge and i\\'ve had no luck. bought a used phone from seller and it had very minor scuff marks on the back of the phone. flashed it to the nightly cyanogen mod 11 rom and works great.phone was almost double on ebay.great phone for straight talk att or t-mobile micro sim card from walmart will work. just a few lines to endorse what i think was very helpful service, which is too rare sometimes. i had a few personal challenges which meant i had to edit my order, and i am totally impressed with the assistance i got from the wireless circle which made it way less problematic than i expected.thanks wireless circle! bueno very fast good phone love it i\\'ve been using this phone for a couple of days now, and after watching, reading, and hearing all these reviews as well as feedback from others, i had an idea of what to expect going into purchasing this device.i saw a few have issues with the phone bending, similar to the iphone 6 plus when that first released. i\\'ve been babying it and taking care of the phone as much as possible, and in that time i\\'ve fallen in love. my personal experience is the ui is nice and clean, similar to stock android with a few added extras, and it\\'s very responsive. i know it\\'s not 4k all the time, and until the marshmallow update releases, there won\\'t be much support as of yet, however the up scaling of videos in the youtube app still look simply amazing. the camera isn\\'t really want most hyped it up to be, but i find that it works well and edges out my note 4 and my father\\'s iphone 6s plus, which is perfect enough for me.from the general feel of the build quality, i\\'d have to mark sony down as the \"apple\" of androids, since i haven\\'t personally felt that the other android devices did it for me. i tried the note 5, s6 edge plus, iphone 6s plus, nexus 6p, and multiple others, but the xperia takes the cake in feeling the most premium to me. calls sound crystal clear, and the front facing speakers, while not as powerful as some htc or motorola phones, still sound much better than my previous iphone.all in all, love the device, hope sony continues to push out updates for it in the future, and i may stick with them should they continue producing this type of quality into their devices. it didn\\'t say it was the duos version and that was disappointing, beside the security seal arrived broken. best phone for this year. i had a samsung s3 and later a samsung s4. i thought about to buy a samsung s5 but in all reviews lg g3 is best phone. i took the risk and i\\'m not disappointed. minor blemishes on the back for a \"new factory unlocked gsm iphone 5c\" but all in all i\\'m satisfied buen telefono i need some help in order to use all its facilites. supposed to be brand new. wasn\\'t. wouldn\\'t charge. this is an unlocked, international version of the samsung galaxy s6 edge phone. do not be alarmed when you read the package instructions that it must be activated in a country other than the one in which you reside. the instructions for my phone indicated that i needed to first use the phone in a southeast asian country, but i went to the local at&t store to get a new sim card (because this phone requires a smaller sim card than my previous nexus 5), and the phone worked in the u.s. immediately.i thought that i would use the \"edge\" notifications a lot more than i do. in fact, i find that i wish i had purchased the flat-screen samsung galaxy s6 instead. that said, i\\'m quite pleased with the performance of this phone. i know samsung battery is not thaaaat good compared to others but this device has a 3300 mah battery (!!!!) it was supposed to be a really good one. it was getting super hot at first and i was like wtf. anyway it\\'s ok now and i really love it. oh! the calender keeps crashing :/ actually it never worked. so im giving 3 stars. for this price range..this is excellent phone. iam using this phone for daily normal use. no issues. but one design issue. wrong placement of power button. very average battery life. i was fooled by the item description. it was totally below expectations. i could not even use the phone. seems that they were just trying to place a broken phone to innocent buyers... excellent phone very happy with it came with ios 8.1.2 so i\\'m able to jailbreak it wonderful flip phone! unlocked version. the only reason i did not give this a 5 star rating is because the camera is low quality but is is a phone! pretty, easy to read and easy to navigate! i would definitely order this again! it glitch after a while of use... i like the first version better plus the screen is way too small i purchased this phone because it was unlocked and i could use it with my tracfone account. of course, it took tracfone several tries to get the settings correct so i could use it as a phone. . as a phone it works fine, i have been dropped a few times but overall not bad. i do not use 90% of the apps that came on the phone. therefore i cannot comment on them.i found that the only unlocked sim cards they make for this phone is 4g. granted it has two slots but if you install additional apps 4g is not that much space. the sim cards are larger than the normal sim cards sold in most stores and i am still looking for larger capacity. if anyone know of 8g or larger sim cards that will fit in this phone, please let me know. i purchased this phone looking for an upgrade to my old 900. the phone i received was a 3g only variant and i was on a 4g plan. i wasn\\'t even aware that there was a 3g only version when i purchased this phone. the description no where stated that it was 3g only. returned the phone. great i purchased this phone for one of my sons. he is a heavy user of its cell phone and he is completely happy with it. he was using an iphone 3gs and the galaxy alpha implied a huge improvement.for him. all the applications run very fast and it works with the 4g (lte) network, which is pretty much faster than the 3g network. great phone. excelente great phone put in at&t sim and it was go to go.works very well.love it well worth the money.24 month warranty also. amazing phone - great deal first off i was sceptical on this purchase but now that i have it and activated it through straight talk verizon it works like a charm. the camera is great! i love taking photos with it! i definitely recommend it to people being as it\\'s got a good screen size and it never lags. definitely will buy again if ever needed. especially if they bring out a new generation. definitely 5 star worthy to me. price was great and arrived quickly. works for internet sharing. excelente producto. fue entregado en el tiempo previsto y funciona perfectamente en venezuela. tiene dos semanas de uso y no ha presentado ningùn problema... phone is a good blackberry and had no problems with the phone itself or getting onto my local phone network, just dropped in my sim and up and running ... not much else to sayedit:it has been several months now and phone has preformed flawlessly, could not be happier. the phone came in alright condition. it has scratches and dings on. but it does not come with a sim and it is not clearly noted on the description. make sure you have a sim because it\\'s a huge pain to get one! two to three weeks shipping for me. it is a really nice phone, looks nice, works well. and it is cheap compare to other cell phone came faster then expected, thanks cellathon. i\\'ve used androids and iphones, so this is the first time i used a windows phone. so as i\\'ll be using this as my work phone, i\\'ll be learning and getting use to the phone. excellent phone... all android software works perfect! full configuration. battery very good if some apps. are well configured. great phone fast delivery! definitely will recommend excelente smart phones are not always smart and i do not want a smart phone and i like this flip style with letters to type this was fraud on my account i\\'m from argentina and this phone is excellent, i love it! works great and it\\'s very easy to handle. the screen resolution is amazing as well as the cam. i\\'m very happy with my purchase. i\\'d like to thank the seller who delivered it asap and in excellent conditions. i love was pleasantly surprised by this phone. excellent screen color. bright. phone is zippy and i love the ribbed back. great condition, although it comes without headphones (i don\\'t mind, the apple ear pods hurt my ears anyways) but it also does not come with a sim card. so i ordered one from a third party on amazon but also was seeing their reviews from other customers and gotten worried. i ended up trying to talk to an at&t associate online not only ending up wasting my time because the site wasn\\'t working because i followed his directions yet, ended up on the same page and wouldn\\'t add the free sim card to my cart. so basically i have to wait until the 30th or even maybe the 5th on july to get this iphone activated. its good that i bought this phone though because my old iphone 4 was starting to die on me. great features; perfect weight and size; fast and responsive - when not frozen! the phone regularly freezes and, way too often, will not wake up from sleep mode. i am constantly rebooting the phone. became a hazard when needing to make an emergency call. shopping for a replacement now. shame - i really wanted to love this phone. love the phone ! but the volume is horriable very low ! only hear if someone is calling if the phone is right in front of me and if there is no surrounding sound or noise. otherwise i would have given 5 stars because i love all other features. good works great, no issues i\\'ve had this phone for almost a month now, and i love it! i would recommend it to anyone, i had the boost mobile before this phone and the phone i had was the lg stylo the phone is just a little bit bigger but this blu phone is so much better! i have so much more room on this phone for my apps. before i had like 3 or 4 apps total before i\\'d get that little thing saying my space was low ugh, i was always having to download apps then uninstall over and over again, it was a pain but now i have like 4 games my audible app with all my books my amazon kindle app with all my other books and of course my google books with more books. i had none of those on my other phone to much space. oh that was another thing to i couldn\\'t use my memory sd card to save some of my apps to, but i\\'m able to almost all them with this phone. the only problems i have with the phone are not really problems for me, the camera isn\\'t the greatest but it takes pictures and there decent. also when i listen to music it isn\\'t as loud as i like it but i have an mp3 player so it\\'s fine. anyway if your debating this phone i\\'d say go for it! but like other have said it\\'s not iphone or galaxy but compared to the prepaid phones i\\'ve had this thing is way closer then any others i\\'ve had ( lg volt, lg stylo, aquos crystal) and i have had iphone, galaxy s3 and s5 hope this helps! its just a basic phone. need lot of improvement and basic feature like compass etc. front camera picture quality is poor does not feel like 2m pix great phone! ii had a htc one v. using the htc one m8 is like entering a new world. very good and powerful phone. the charging port went out after 6 months. but, dealing with blu was a very pleasant experience. they replaced it with a better phone, no questions asked. but, i love the phone! great reception and this phone is fast! no quiere cargar bad battery life leaves something to be desired, but other than that i couldn\\'t be happier! i have some trouble with a independent seller and the order was canceled but after the reorder through amazon direct handling everything was ok.... great phone it works very well as i traveled to mexico real good deal. i have had it for 5 months i don\\'t know if it is software or hardware problem but the battery drains pretty fast and the phones heats a lot. works great! love these things and amazon;) thank you great phones as i bought 4 of them at varying times for family members and everyone is satisfied and loves the phone. on a recent outing and trying to find the right turn to make on the road, one of my grandson\\'s used his phone to navigate us right to the exact location and it was way out in the boondocks, so it was well worth it that time. so far i enjoy this device does everything i needed it to do. i would definitely keep shopping with amazon wireless hub were really great , the phone is amazing just got it and i don\\'t know if its the battery or the phone but it wont hold a charge or charge properly. i\\'ve tried several chargers and it happens to all of them, it won\\'t charge anymore past the battery % of when i plugged it in. very upset, and now i have to go through more trouble of trying to return and get a new one. not ordering from this company again and wouldn\\'t recommend them. i really love this phone but when i bought it after like a month the phone camera stopped working suddenly as well as the flashlight which is a real bummer. i have to go fix it next week thursday or friday so yeah that\\'s it arrived quickly and works well, looks brand new to help the people find the stuff that fullfil their expectations, excellent orientation .. .. . . . . . this phone is not completly unlocked as annunced. it was unable to be used in venezuela because it is supposed that you have to introduce a network password. do not buy this product if you wanna use it in other country bought it for my wife last month. it\\'s working smoothly since then. finger print scanner works very accurate and pretty fast, its advantage is that now kids don\\'t get to use her phone. camera picture quality is fine, neither of us is a camera enthusiasts so it works with us. speakers are quite loud and sound it pretty good to ears. build is pretty good, doesn\\'t feel cheap in hand. had it for a couple of weeks now. looks like stock android, which is great. comes with everything you need, including a bumper case and screen protector, which is above and beyond. everything seems to load up pretty quickly, including websites. battery seems to last a couple of days at least if it\\'s not being used, which is great.pros:+ price! half the price of most unlocked phones.+ android 4.4 kit kat, and blu says they\\'ll be doing upgrades to lollipop in june, so basically the latest version of android.+ removable battery! thank god! it\\'s nice to be able to replace the battery yourself and give the phone to your kids. or just buy a bigger one without depending on someone to open the phone up. this is the way it should be. phones don\\'t need to be thinner than this anyways.+ bumper case, screen protector and even pretty comfortable earbuds with remote and mic are included.cons:- unfortunately, every emergency number is programmed in, including 123, which is my provider\\'s voicemail number. i found a way around it, but it\\'s a little annoying.- can\\'t find any alternative cases to purchase for it, but the included bumper case seems to be more than sufficient, so no biggie.- hardware buttons not back-lit. a little harder to use in the dark. can be remedied with software apps, however.- \"video-call\" camera seemed a little weak, but this will be used very little anyways. the normal camera, however, took some great photos.- voice on speakerphone didn\\'t sound so great. but again, probably won\\'t be used that much at all. using the phone normally sounds fine.to me, this is probably as complete as a budget smartphone as you can get. this might make me jump off of the ios bandwagon completely. the phone is nice but they didn\\'t give me a charger that works at where i live. that was really disappointing. excelente great phone. camera is amazing, but sometimes the software lags. hopefully software updates sort that out. the fingerprint scanner is blistering fast and 100% accurate. feels great in the hand, love the \\'smaller\\' form factor and phones less than huge are getting hard to find. battery is what kept me from giving it 5 stars. if you have the money, and want the pure android experience, go for the 6p. if not, this is a very capable phone and you will love it. best phone i have ever owned. windows 8 truly shines on devices. i will never be going back to droid. phone is working perfectly, very good buy no regrets phone arrived in perfect condition and as expected. however, these phones are not well built and i have had to have several repairs made to the phone without inflicting actual damage. sometimes my screen won\\'t work, the home button is falling out, vibration sometimes will suddenly not work - all within the first few months of having the phone. i have used iphones for several years but this will be my last one. making the switch as soon as possible. excellent love the color! really practical to carry documents. simply all good but could use longer battery life super great phone. had a note 4 but wanted something water proof after some close calls. don\\'t miss the note 4 a bit. my sister and i bought this phone for my mom and she loves it! very good started phone for someone who does not know cell phones very well..lol stopped charging after one week. not impressed. great seller. i asked them about whether the refurbished phone had any scratches on the screen or back and frame. i was told that if i purchased a phone from them, they would send me a nice clean phone. after much thought and research, i decided to purchase the lg optimus g pro e980. really fast delivery and to my shock and surprise, the phone i received, looked like a brand new phone. came with a case, charger, usb cable. no manual, but i downloaded one off the lg site. it is a beautiful phone and works great! exceptional camera and tons of apps. only con is speaker distorts at really high volume. but, i still i highly recommend this phone and the seller. again great seller. i wouldnt connect to any sever junk i bought this phone as a gift for my friend who lives overseas. the phone arrived promptly and it was in a mint condition. i couldn\\'t figure out how to charge it (connecting the charger just wouldn\\'t do anything) and thus turn it on. but after googling the subject and playing with different variations of reset, and taking out the battery a few times, it started charging fine. (this problem never popped up again and i am still not sure what exactly was the reason for not charging in the first place).i personally like the android os much better (i own a samsung galaxy tab 10.1 and also have used the s2 for quite a few days) but i still prefer to stick with the iphone (as far as smartphone). it takes better pictures and feels more solid overall. (whereas the galaxy s2 is very lite and made of cheap plastic). never again ! arrived on time and product is exactly as expected. i did not see much difference between s5 and s4 except s5 crashed several time when using internet . there is no more exciting options for photo editing tool. another annoying thing is some extra apps were automatically installed when starting from factory setting. default language is germany. the date showed in \\'phone hidden\\' bar back to year of 2013. a little bit confusing about this product. quality phone, but does not come with android 4.4 as indicated by the title, mine came with android 5.1 installed. in my case this is important. the phone is a good phone bit i got a 2900 battery instead of 3000 this pone does not work on verizon network. it appeared from all that i read about it that it was supposed to. very disappointed 16 year old girl on christmas. ....they should have full coverage for the phone, i dropped it on carpet cuz someone bumped me and they won\\'t do nothing about it, sounds dumb to me. great phone, has withstood quite a bit of abuse, the phone is very nice and holds a charge well. i don\\'t like that the keyboard is different from my other phone. the other one was so much easier to type on. great android phone and a great deal through virgin mobile. if you have good reception from virgin mobile (sprint) in your area, i would definitely recommend this phone. fast processor and a beautiful screen. phone is great. everything works just fine. works like $500 android but with dual sim.occasionally have to reboot by removing battery when switch fails to respond.super thin and has started to bend like new iphones! si cumplieronnn i broke my work phone and needed a new one quickly and they responded right away when i reached out to them. got my phone promptly and in the condition described. the only thing was, the earbuds were missing which i didn\\'t really care about. to me, it was the best priced phone of its value that was compatible with verizon. it has 64 gigs, runs fast, is way more powerful than all my colleague\\'s samsungs. when i want to upgrade, i\\'m definitely going to see what this seller has available first. received my xperia z3+ :). item as described, super fast shipping. worked successfully with t-mobile nano sim card. had to adjust the settings on the device a little bit on network provider, but it did work!. lte signal worked. call t-mobile customer service in case you have any issues with the connection, since it should work well in the us. completely satisfied with my purchase. a+++++ realmente es un teléfono muy útil y divertido para quienes necesitamos un tlf tipo pda (sin necesitar de muchas aplicaciones tontas de juegos y otras que los niños u otros mas jóvenes estarían interesados). se conecta a las wi-fi de manera muy rápida y fácil y ademas con una conexión de datos bastante rápida también. sin embargo uso el fb, el whatsapp, espnsoccernet y otros de manera habitual y satisfactoriamente.es de notar, que al ser un tlf de pantalla táctil no es para ser usado por quienes andamos apurados pues a la hora de buscar un contacto o un numero de la agenda resulta algo incomodo(pero esto sucede con todos los teléfonos de la categoría). el teléfono tiene un teclado qwerty muy práctico que permite escribir de manera muy eficiente. la cámara es buena para los espacios abiertos y soleados, regular para los entornos cerrados y con luz artificial a pesar de los múltiples intentos por configurarla correctamente.en otros aspectos, hay ciertos detalles que deberían poder ser cambiados (pero al menos, hasta ahora no he logrado). uno de ellos y muy importante es poder ver los números de tlf de cada contacto al momento de ver los registros y de hacer una llamada. esto es practico porque por lo general, siempre interesa verlo para identificar la operadora a la que haremos la llamada (porque para quienes usamos planes prepagados puede resultar en un gasto mayor al llamar una operadora diferente a la que estamos afiliados).por otra parte, si les interesa pueden hacer algunos ajustes para evitar consumir batería inútilmente. entre ellos, desactivar el sensor de movimiento (que hace rotar la pantalla de manera automática y aun cuando no lo queremos). también pueden cambiar el tiempo que dura la pantalla encendida después de dejar el tlf en standby (dura unos 60 segundos de manera predeterminada y pueden reducirlo hasta 5 segundos). la conexión de datos también debe colocarse en la opción \"cuando es necesario) de otra forma siempre estará conectado.del resto, creo que no se sentirán decepcionados. en verdad es muy bueno! eso si, no lo usen al conducir porque aparte de ser indebido, será casi imposible por el hecho de ser táctil y realmente nadie quiere que suceda algo malo por ello.saludos desde venezuela. blackberry classic q20 is my second blackberry smart phone after using blackberry q10.\\xa0blackberry q10 unlocked cellphone, 16gb, blacki\\'ve used blackberry q10 for a while but q10 is a little slow when i used application from android os and i felt stuffy while web surfing because of its small screen! so i want blackberry smart phone with wider screen and better specification. so i bought this blackberry class for me!1. appearancewhen i saw this first, i was really excited about its semblance. right. i cannot help saying about its appearance. blackberry class is for \\'design\\' (or \\'just design\\' in a certain sense). i really like its design. it bring a nobleman or a person who work in specialized job to my mind. really cool and professional! i want you to see the left side of blackberry class. there are two slot, one for micro sd card and one for sim. they are put over by pin which like iphone. the material used for slot and edge makes blackberry class more simple and classic!2. softwareblackberry classic show us blackberry which approach android os. i can use application from android store like google store or amazon app store more smoothly. but still it uses blackberry os. not faster like android phones, but quiet nice for using application or web surfing. the screen bigger than q10 helps its pleasant environment.3. elsei think the detail on this amazon page is not enough. this page have to show consumers the more information at least this blackberry classic is 100-4. this can make consumer to decide to buy or not, the core information.i like blackberry but i want more innovation of blackberry. had it almost a week. no problems. just put in my sum card from my s111 and no problem. great case...and real sturdy... and thin enough to allow my iphone 5s to fit comfortably in my pocket. although the sender was very helpful the product was not compatible with my carrier really cool, i love it. good deal! this is the slowest, stupidest, most absolutely obnoxious phone i have ever used. it downloads unwanted content all of the time and it switches the date and time every time i answer the phone. i would never buy this phone again. excellent product but it was not what you expected, annex the expected product image ok. very good. thanks good afternoon i received the phone is locked does not recognize the card without my line is movistar sim trajeta says that is not compatible excellent it\\'s used and there is some privete information in it. i can\\'t recover the pin the best phone i ever had, nice camera and general performance. muy bueno i bought this phone so that i could have a phone with no internet, as partial \"unplug\" thing. it works great, although there are a few drawbacks. it has a very small sms memory, so the inbox fills up pretty quickly. it doesn\\'t have a way to auto-delete oldest first, so you have to either delete everything, including your newest messages, or individually delete each older message, which gets time consuming. i text a lot, so that\\'s a big annoyance for me.i also wish that you could send it a picture via mms (since there\\'s no data port and no internet, that leaves only mms) to set as a background picture. alas, it doesn\\'t handle mms at all. that also makes receiving group messages nearly impossible, as most smartphones send group messages as mms instead of sms.call quality is pretty good though, and it came with a handsfree wired (it doesn\\'t have bluetooth) headset.the sim tray is easy to use; because it is a tray, not a slot, i was able to insert the micro-sim from my smartphone without any trouble.battery life is excellent. i took this on a business trip for two weeks, using it to text and talk for a couple hours each day, and only had to charge it a few times. so far it works perfectly. battery life could be better, slim design is less important for me and probably for most people. easy setup for dual sim cards, you can choose freely which will use mobile data and assign contacts to sims. one sim is micro the other is mini by the way. might be difficult to use a micro sim with an adapter in the mini sim slot due to the design. great phone! it charges quickly and responds immediately to commands. good camera, also. love the size. love the features. best thing to replace my blackberry. really good photos. also it is very simple to use. excellent product!!!! but two of the couple years ago. works ok. i like the sliding part for texting purposes. it makes a great gift i purchased a lg g3 d851 32gb black smartphone for t-mobile from you on december 5, 2015. the phone has echo issue when talking to people they can hear themselves and i can hear myself as i speak also.i contacted lg and based on the imei number this is a refurbished phone and had been sent in to them by t-mobile once for repair. this phone was manufactured back july 2014 and is 2 years old. there is no warranty on this phone. it is not a new phone as you implied. now i am stuck with a product that does not work and for the most part not usable.very disappointed. well i was stuck between paying for the note 3 and being locked into a two year contract (or at least until the phone was paid off) through t-mobile or remaining contractless buy just outright buying a phone. i didn\\'t exactly have the extra funds available to just buy like a $700 phone. so, a co-worker told me about blu phones. after checking out their website, i decided i wanted the blu pure life xl. however, i was uneasy about forking over $400 for a phone by a company i had never heard of. after much debating with myself, i decided to get the blu life pure.i have to give kudos to amazon\\'s customer service. the first phone i ordered was stolen off my porch and amazon sent me a replacement. it was a flawless process!anyway, i\\'ve had the phone for a couple of days now and i love it! when the phone arrived, i popped my sim card from my nexus 4 to the blu life pure. it was quite simple. i had no issues putting my sim card in and it instantly started working on t-mobile\\'s network. i did pick up 4g and honestly.... i have no issues with speed. the phone is pretty fast on t-mobile\\'s network. of course, i live in a big city. i have no idea what it would be like out in the country. the phone picks up wireless networks and connects to them flawlessly as well. also, i can create hotspots with the phone. i was excited to find that out cause i connect my tablet to my hot spot at work.the phone has a 13 megapixel camera and it takes very good pictures though not so great in low light. the front-facing camera is great too and i like that you can add effects to the pictures. the stock launcher on it reminds me of the iphone. it\\'s not bad but i don\\'t care for it so i use nova launcher and i customized the phone the way i liked it. i use nova launcher on pretty much all android phones anyway. the phone also has 32gb of space. i downloaded two huge games (ff3 and ff4) from the playstore and i still got plenty of space left. it handles graphic intensive games pretty well. i noticed no lag while playing ff3. the only issue i\\'ve encountered with the playstore is that the sims free play wasn\\'t compatible with the phone and that\\'s not a big deal for me. however, everything else i play and use has downloaded with absolutely no problems.the sound is very good. the phone is loud and i love that! that was an issue i had with my nexus 4 - i thought the sound was way too low. i have no trouble hearing people on phone calls and everyone says they can hear me just fine. the sound for the speaker phone is just right in my opinion - not too low, not too loud. i must admit though, holding the phone up to your ear can get uncomfortable due to the corners of the phone.i did have some trouble connecting the bluetooth to my car. for whatever reason, my phone wouldn\\'t detect the bluetooth in my car but then one night while trying, my car\\'s bluetooth suddenly popped up and it connected with no problems. so i\\'m able to stream music through my phone. the music did sound better through my nexus 4; however, it doesn\\'t sound bad with the blu life pure (just not as good). but i\\'m not really an audiophile so i can\\'t really explain the difference but there is a difference. the music really sounds \"just okay\" vs. \"omfg awesome\" coming through my car speakers via bluetooth. with my nexus 4, it would show the name of the song across the screen of my radio but not with the blu life pure. i\\'m not sure why but it\\'s not that big of a deal. at least it works. now, i have been having trouble connecting my jbl speaker to the phone. it seems the life pure really sucks at detecting bluetooth connections. but when it does, there is usually no problems with actually connecting it.i\\'ve been told by quite a few people that the phone looks like an iphone. i don\\'t really see that myself but since i\\'ve had two co-workers and my brother tell me that, i guess it must be true. also, the phone feels lighter than it looks. i was really surprised by how light the phone feels. i know that making phones really light is the trend now but i personally prefer phones that feel a bit heavier. but it\\'s all good.i\\'ve dropped the phone a few times and it still works just fine. no cracks or anything in the screen. so i\\'d say thus far it\\'s pretty durable.i don\\'t know how well the gps works cause i haven\\'t used it.other than not being able to download the sims free play, i\\'ve yet to see this phone do something my nexus 4 couldn\\'t do. i love this phone and blu has made a believer out of me. i\\'m an average user... things about processors and ram makes no sense to me. i just want to know can my phone connect to the internet? can i talk and text? can i take at least decent pictures? can i connect it to bluetooth? can i download my favorite games? the answer to all these questions are yes! so the phone gets a 5/5 rating from me! the phone is so cool! i love it! my brother is even considering buying one now. i think this phone is awesome for the price tag that comes with it. when i do decide to upgrade my phone again, i\\'ll definitely be purchasing another blu phone. no more phones that cost more than my car note! it\\'s heavy and not quite as responsive as some of the lumia phones my family has. the display doesn\\'t seem quite as good either. the lumia phones are a better value. it does have dual sim slots though if you need that. the phone is great except the battery isn\\'t very good. great product! always use an otter box. this one covers the screen as well. is not waterproof.tough and durable. a little bulky, but thats why it works so well. it worked fine until 2 weeks ago, the phone restart itself and doesn\\'t aloud to make an update of the os. i don\\'t know if is an issue of blu or of android. but either way i would highly recommend to avoid buying this item.and i can\\'t even make a return now because the window for doing that is closed already (how convenient for the seller.) it reboots itself once in a while , while using navigation. i\\'m a lyft driver. i got this as a gift for my mom. it was a little challenged to get the sim card in at first but after the sim was inserted it worked perfectly. she loves her phone and states that the fact that it flips open is a plus. is okay was a gift for my wife, i like a lot . works excellent on cricket. no issues, this is a truly unlocked phone. had purchased a so called unlocked phone from a retail store that calls it self the best to buy at. they even had displayed signs saying \"free to choose\". except after paying more then $800 i found out freedom came after paying another $300 over a 6 month period, to ole ma-bell. then they would provide me an unlock code for my \"unlocked\" phone.if you\\'re looking for a unlocked that\\'s really, buy it here. fyi 2g phone. i bought two of these and had to return because at&t nolonger supports 2g phones. we emailed plum and verified. they did seem sturdy and well made but was unable to use them so i cannot speak to call quality. i received my package and only the phone shell came no charger no battery perfect for a spare phone. great service and product. excelente telefono. muy bien todo phone has gorrilla glass, fast shipping great deal. excellent phone. excellent! i recently ordered this phone in dec 2014 and i shipped it to a friend who brought it to the caribbean for me. firstly, i went to put in a sim card by my isp and they told me that the phone was locked and the description by the seller said the phone was unlocked. i was really disappointed as i had to pay over us$20 to get it unlocked. my thing is just be truthful when describing phones. also the tethering is also blocked and i am still trying to find a way to unblock it.on the flip side, the phone functions well and i love it especially the cam as it takes clean pictures. the phone was also shipped just as it said it would. #thumbs up to speedy delivery wow !!! at this price u will nvr find a better phone.. been seven months since using.. nvr a problem.. in this budget, go for it :) this is a very high quality product which in-person is just as advertised. i was very surprised at the overall look of the book. images are clear and step-by step is well done. was a little rocky but at the end good the cell phone came unlocked but i cannot run the internet and the social networks,, additional cannot run the 3g,, the seller has to review the product before sell it,,, cheap and functionally good. almost 4 months and phone is still working great. very satisfied! received order very fast everything was good great product ! really looked like new ! am a very happy customer very good i\\'m very happy with this phone. the button on the side feels a little odd at first but other than that it reminds me of samsung galaxy s3 which i loved but couldn\\'t transfer from boost to att. i hate all the go phones from att but i like the service . this phone is a great replacement for it and for the price you can\\'t beat that. the android system is really good and customizable. i like that it has two sim slots. i\\'m thinking about getting a second sim for international calls. so far i\\'m liking this phone a lot. if i woukd have stuck with android this would have been my go to phone, but i went with the 6 plus. not because apple is cooler or makes a better phone, but because of content. better apps across the board. i create music and apple has a much more music apps for ios than android. if it weren\\'t for that, i\\'d be with the note 4. cant make the voice activation work. it came from samsung-vietnam.. hard to get warranty help (so far). very good item, is very functional and has the lastes things for its operation that a cell phone can offer at these days. it seemed like a good phone from what i could tell i just could not use it with the carrier that i have which is tracfone junk jet phone wow so small and bulky. i own and love other apple products but not that commited to the cause. i returned it and bough a samsung galaxy. i wanted a bigger screen. not sure if my comment still counts. i love this phone, the best phone i ever had so far!!! buy it you will not regret it trust me! within 2 weeks phone\\'s camera not working, my first experience with amazon is not good... i am planning to share the same in social media had trouble from the start accessing the internet thought we had it working and quit again. started having problems with the screen. returned phone. its a verizon phone , with option to get it partially working with other company sim.i always get verizon logo with message this is not a verizon sim.i would\\'t call it unlocked. or put it under this category. good this is my 2nd blu phone and i love this one too!!! i wore the other one out and now here i am, happy with this one too!!! this one is better then ever!!! whole family has own blu phone\\'s and everyone is very happy also!!! excellent article according to the publication, the purchase is recommended really is very good team and brings all its accessories do not need to purchase protective lining or lamina son loves his phone , just as well as a higher name brand. no headphones geat phone! works perfectly with metropcs!! beautiful phone!! the watch is ok. basic, no frills. you are getting what you pay for. besides needing a extra sim card and a blue tooth head phone this watch works great. the price is great to a lot less then the $ 200.00 that the other guys are asking. sim-card tray was missing! -.- perfect size and options for my 78 yr old mom. really like this phone works perfectly. only thing is the camera quality isn\\'t the best..... very good for international use. it was a great device but the sound needs improving. donnot buy it if you are at usa and with t-mobile service, no 4 g connection this phone is locked,and i\\'m having one hell of a time trying to get it unlocked. i was on the phone with ting all afternoon yesterday. also , surprise, it\\'s an at&t phone . i was not made aware of this until i opened the package. i am returning the phone. i recently purchase this phone from this seller. but it is locked to at&t and shipping package doest not have any acceseries associated with this phone except charger ie not headset, sim ejecting tool, manual, no warranty and nothing.it is used phone. i advice not to buy this item. very good seller good product and i recommend it 100% to the community, an excellent and functional phone with all operators and very fast and easy handling. regards horrible will never buy again i\\'ve always bought nokia phones because of their quality and workmanship. the 6700 slide lacked the workmanship that nokia is famous for. the slide itself is slightly off and is not a clean fit. this is very disappointing. the materials used are still top notch but that is not an excuse for such poor workmanship. there are also problems with the email software supplied. it is often glitchy and needs to be reset from time to time.these problems aside, i can say that the audio quality is excellent. the best i\\'ve ever experienced in a nokia. very clean and crisp and excellent reception even in tunnels. also battery life is solid and the screen is very good and clear. the camera is ok. overall it is a barely above average phone. the sound quality is what saves it from being a failure. never came with the sim cards coudnt fin this phone anywhere but i found it here and it was great!! the price was good and it looked brand new!! got it for my daughter and she loves the phone. the only thing is, she said the battery looks used! i had nokia x3 three phones for a year. one stopped working too soon. second\\'s touch screen isn\\'t working. it is probably a time to get a new model. muy buen equipo, sus funciones, pantalla, lo recomiendo si les gusta disfrutar de las ventajas de un equipo bb a un precio razonable. good phone that works as advertised with both sims. the sound is better using the ear buds while on the phone. speaker could be more powerful. ability to upgrade storage space is a plus. i particular like that i don\\'t have to carry two phones anymore the phone would not open to the home screen no matter how often i swiped. altogether i hated it great phone in great condition. just want my husband wanted since he doesn\\'t use i phones. small and compact and fits on his belt. \"both cell phones with android system problems, one of the boxes and lacked accessories.\"i was really unlucky to receive a product in poor condition and incomplete great item for friction of price. work great overseas. unfortunately the device came defective. i live in brazil and i can not solve ... was a disappointment for my daughter who was eager for a blackberry awesome service and went out of way to make sure my purchase was good. the phone is happily being used by the recipent as a gift. as far as i am concerned this is a good phone that works fine with tracfone as long as you get the tracfone sim card from wal mart. good and light, afgordable. works great! the product is good 100% and was shipped in the same day and im fine with the service the product is good 100% and was shipped in the same day and im fine with the service. love it perfect! love the phone! bought this phone twice from same company . first phone was great, but someone stole it from my brother. second phone didn\\'t work, it was too late to return when i sent it to jamaica. more than what i expected. thank you chubbies i like this figo phone but i can\\'t even download the facebook app. i had it. went to download another app and couldnt because it says my storage is full. i delete everything out of my phone storage and delete everything off my sd card. still couldn\\'t not download the app. deleted the facebook app and now it is saying my internal storage is too full. other than the storage it is a good phone. serius reception problems in temazcal dr in santa monica ca.,phone calls dropped, the camera quality is way far from the lg 2 camerawith lg 2, never had this problems this is my first samsung galaxy phone, and i feel that this experience is great because this phone is the best smartphone on the market right now, therefore i feel happy and excited to have that kind of phone. it is just like new, works great!! i really like this phone. unfortunately, i could not answer incoming phone calls. ver y good i bought this s*** two months ago and it doesn\\'t work anymore. holy s***! muy bien cool very cool to have this is the second one i have bought and they both broke. this time the clip broke off the very next day. i love it. the phone works and looks great thus far (one day) and the seller, onestopshoppe. was great. excellent! it sucked very happy with my purchase, price, shipping and arrival time! very fast delivery. my 1st lg phone and it\\'s simply just awesome love my new phone. i was sketchy in the beginning about it being an international phone.... but it works great! the phone came with a us adapter for the charger. i\\'m buying another j7 for my husband next. definitely recommend this phone! bad things- short battery life.bad service connection.nobody can hear me unless i plug in the earphones.cannot lable notes in the note taking feature.good things- talk text.... excelente works great will do business again dont buy it!!!i bought 2 and had problems with both of them.battery of both lasts only 4 hours. and in one of them i cant use 2g, 3g nor 4g when its supposed to work.(im frrm argentina). looks like new works like new. doesn\\'t looks like refurbished.delivered with original case and charger. best deal i would ever get on an apple watch i like it thanks , my phone work very well in venezuela too slow a great phone for the price. the camera is nice because now i can download my pictures on to my computer, which i could not do with my old phone. llego en buen estado y completo funciona a la perfeccion todavia lo estoyusando realmente compre lo que queria gracias the best phone ever made i switched to this from a galaxy s4 because i wanted a durable android phone usable with one hand - imho they are making them way too big now days.very satisfied with this phone. as someone who uses their phone for calls, email, texts, and music, its tech specs are more than adequate. it even plays the newer games very smoothly though that\\'s less important. also the fact that it\\'s water proof is a major plus on my long bike rides.4g lte speeds are also much, much faster than they were on my s4. the screen, although smaller, is brilliant and sharp because the pixels are so densely packed. the screen looks and feels just like the original iphone 4 screen. that is, it looks like a retina display, can\\'t see any pixels (and i have 20/10 vision).all things considered, however, i would have liked a better quality camera - a lot of the low-light photos come out very grainy, and the mountain-panorama shots i take while on rides don\\'t have the resolution i would like. all told though i can\\'t complain, much better than the s4 excellent returned phone. i have had iphones, and liked them, but this windows phone is the best i have ever encountered. the operating system works flawlessly, thousands of good practical and entertaining apps are available for any interest or need...and call quality is excellent.battery life could be longer, but i do spend an inordinate amount of time reading on mine so.... there are now 5 of these phones in my house. i\\'ve had mine since 2011 and it has been dropped hundreds of times from minnesota to afghanistan and it hasn\\'t died yet. i\\'m talking about the kind of drops that shoot the battery 10 feet in one direction and the phone in the other. i really like this phone because i just want a sturdy phone that can send texts. a phone for making phone calls. and texting. and nothing else. okay, i keep some calendar events in there too but mainly i make calls and send texts and, whenever i drop it, it keeps working--going on 6 years now. also, my 4 kids all have the same model because i swear that those animals could break an anvil so i got them this tank of a phone so i don\\'t have to replace their phones every 5 minutes. the kids don\\'t have data plans nor are they getting one anytime soon. all they need are phones that make phone calls and send texts so their mom can know their every movement. it\\'s like she\\'s tagged some bears and is tracking their migration (at the lowest possible cost). and none of the kids have broken their phones either. how long have the kids had them? a total of nearly 8 years between them. add that to my 6 years of ownership and we have 5 lg octanes with almost 14 years of total usage with no defects thus far. i hope i can find another one if mine finally kicks the bucket. i like this phone. a quality phone at an ok price. i\\'ve had this watch for a few days now. it synced to my android just fine. downloaded the app for phone with the qr code. fit is comfortable. i have small wrists and it isn\\'t so huge it bothers me, don\\'t notice it really. all notifications work well. when i get a notification it plays my phone ringtone, so both this and my phone are babbling minions till i check it. the sleep monitor works fine. only tried that once so idk how true but for last night being as i didn\\'t sleep it said poor, seems right. the pedometer works well but is a little slow. takes a few to catch up. texts messages come threw fine and you can reply to them. phone calls come threw but i have not been able to talk on it due to interference with something else in my home (possibly other bluetooth devices interfering). browser, remote capture, image viewer and audio player i cannot get to function. i\\'ve sent an email to the company due to this not really having instructions. there was some but didn\\'t have much info. so overall this is a good starter watch for someone wanting to try a smart watch, which is why i bought it. it works ok for the price. (will add more on email reply from company) i\\'m still getting used to it but i have to say, it is a very nice device. good 💯 good i was extreamly skeptical about buying a used iphone that i could not even see what it looked like, the description said it was in good condition and came with a case and charger. i received my phone 5-6 days before the scheduled delivery date, when i opened the package it made me very weary about it being in a envelope. i was pleased to see that the phone had absolutely no scratches or cracks, when i turned it on it worked perfect! my phone looks brand new and you would never know it was used! i am one happy customer, i haven\\'t activated it yet but if i have a problem i will be sending it back, but im sure i wont! defiantly recommend buying one, you will not be let down! one of the 2 phones come with failure wifi. love this phone can not complain the 2 sim chips work fine for me, the only issue if you could call it like that is that there is so few or none custom roms for the cellphone.if what you want is a phone to use 2 sims then this phone could be the right for you i had this phone for 6 months i had the samsung galaxy 4 note but they are virtually the same thing without the note i\\'ve dropped it a few times and it didn\\'t break so it\\'s definitely durable awesomeeee excellent phone for the value. returned it. basic call text worked and some app notifications. had issue with it resetting the location to a city in south america which would change my time. also didn\\'t like that all sounds from phone went to the watch so media that i had muted blasted from its speaker unintentionally. ended up with refurbished gear 2 and i\\'m happy. when i read the description, it stated that the phone would have light, minimal scratched on the screen. the front and back screen were in great condition, however, there were many more issues. the battery was toast, and shut the phone off at 20%. the metal frame is bent at the top of the phone, making it hard to use a case. the flash doesn\\'t work. the camera has dark spots, the charger that came with the phone doesn\\'t work. the speaker is blown, and people can\\'t hear me. i contacted the seller, and the response was quick, but it was as useful as not contacting them at all. they offered to repair everything minus the metal frame, but i\\'d have to send the phone back on my dollar, and be stuck without a phone until they sent it back. nothing else. of course, i didn\\'t send it back. be very cautious when buying. this is an edit to an earlier review i made. another consumer (i think) pointed out that it uses a different network than verizon and that i should have done my research. well, maybe i should have. but i don\\'t know, i\\'m a consumer, and even though i agree that consumers should indeed do their homework, the majority will read \"super cool quad band watch\". and since there is no disclaimer in the specifications, most would probably buy it. i mean i\\'m not an expert, but how many people really know what gsm or cmda means? if the verizon guy couldn\\'t figure it out......anyway, i bought this product, took it to my cell phone carrier (verizon) and they could not get it to work. because i am not willing or able to search all of the cell phone carriers to find out which one can get it to work, and because of the fact that it is way more bulkier than i thought, i returned it.you know what, in all fairness, i\\'ll upgrade my rating because i can\\'t speak on how it works. but i got a white one and the watch band is a noticeable different shade of white compared to the watch. if you are getting it for your kid like i did, just know that it is bulky and looks like someone grabbed a nokia and trimmed off the key pad and slapped it onto a wristband. just my opinion. again, it might work for you but the look threw me off. this phone advertised incorrect information. this phone does not have 4g lte capability (at least with at&t). i ordered this phone for a family member therefore didnot find out until i played with it recently. not cool man. my iphone that i ordered from amazon worked great. i had no issues with turning it on or getting it activated. came unscathed with charging equipment. i am highly satisfied and love my phone! great phone fast delivery. its okay to used but you cant used any and every headpiece on it, it also freeze now and then. plenty tough but a little slipperier than i would like due to the hard plastic case. i bought another brand for my next phone that was 1/4 the cost and i like it better. is not working properly, is turn off when i using, i think is the battery, i pay for a new telephone and i think is not the phone arrived quickly. it was in original packaging, which was, however, opened to include a simple travel adapter to convert the european plug on the cord to american one for us wall sockets. the packaging was carefully closed again with a similar piece of tape, which of course caused some alarm that there was some foul play. no worries, it was just the plug.the phone has a dual slot for the regular sized sim cards (the so-called mini-sim or 2ff). i have had the phone now a few weeks and it works like a dream. i only needed it as a secondary phone to my heavy duty samsung galaxy s 2 plus and have only installed and used a limited array of applications. i have not had any performance issues with apps or otherwise. i have two european sim cards in it - for business purposes. both cards connect very happily sometimes with at&t and sometimes with t-mobile. in my relatively modest daily use the battery lasts for about three full days before it needs to be recharged. the only, very mild complaint i can make is that samsung has introduced a strong contrast to the screen colours of this model. yes, it makes colours brighter - the ones you can see, but it loses some of the colours in exchange. it is the same problem as with glossy tvs and computer screens. everything looks bright and shiny, but image quality suffers. as i said, this is a very minor issue - on a phone. i would say that for the price i paid, this phone is truly worth every penny. has performed flawlessly so far. nice bright screen and unlike my last phone have been able to install all the apps i want. great phone!!! love love love!!!! i ordered this phone and had to send it out-of-state to my son for whom i had ordered it. it was great until it needed charged and then it wouldn\\'t take the charge. he took it to a verizon store, but it just would not charge. i contacted the company and they are replacing it!! great looking stand!this was a great buy and highly recommend it. i use nightstand app now for my alarm clock and lay my phone horizontal instead of vertical shown in the picture. watch stays stationary now too. very convenient product i bought this for my 13 and 16 year old sons and they absolutely love it! great cell for reasonable price! no regrets buying it! i would recommend this product! blu is awesome! great phone. would luv to review future phones from them. went in this one with mixed feeling. am very pleased with it. doesn\\'t feel like a low end phone. durable and all functions work well. fast loading and large beautiful screen. i am pleasantly surprised. i have a new cell phone company in my life for the future. luv u blu! i ordered one of these in red. expected case for phone to be red also. when i opened it the case is pink and white. it is a gift for my son. and i cannot find a case for this phone anywhere!!! very frustrated!!! good no need to buy the expensive brands this phone has it all really good phone. works good with bluetooth. works great i got the wrong order kargia it is a good choice for adult people who hates the touch screen in smartphones good product.....like it very much. ver good the blackberry that i bought was not new it was used but the advertisenent in amazon said it was new.the battery drained so fast i will omly gave one star. bought this to use in the us on metropcs/t-mobile. it worked perfectly. great features for a \"low budget\" phone. it had some software problems when i got it, like it was really unstable, but then i updated the software and it was just fine. then the gps stopped working and i could no longer navigate outside my zip code. then the frame started peeling. here i was thinking it was metal or something but it looks like it\\'s just shiny metal paint. once it starts peeling in one area, there\\'s no stopping the spread. even with the case on it\\'s still peeling. little tiny chips come off everytime i remove the case, and i can\\'t not remove the case because i hate grimy phones, and i change cases very often. great for the money! very fast, good battery and acceptable camera. the cellphone works fine here in venezuela but, the box where it came was a used one, the phone came from some country that use \"claro\"... looks good but i paid for a new one not used! great deal! i got an amazon gift card when i did my taxes...that was my first mistake. once i got the card, i had to spend it...i looked at phones and ordered a cheap iphone...but after i month i realised it was not coming...i have asked for my money back... all was perfect great upgrade from a samsung galaxy s2. i hate big cellphones so this s5 mini was my best choice. i\\'ve been using it for a couple months and i can\\'t complain. wrong size fast shipper and responds quick! buen gracias had it for a few days now. faster than my nexus 7 2013 according to antutu!! not only that but better camera both rear and front and plus the phone functionality i feel like i\\'m carrying a powerhouse with me in such a small,slim, beautiful phone! might update more in the future. battery life is amazing, that is the main reason i bought this phone. but, if you try to multitask, the phone will have bugs. i was on the phone while trying to email and take photos and it would bug out. so if you need a phone for basic use, with excellent battery life and pretty look, of course large screen...you could be satisfied. once again 2 stars less for a lot of bugs since i am multitasking. nice phone but can not get it to connect to the net. best of the 6 in the smaller body! excellent product!! all what i expected. well i got it when it was on sale, so for the price it was an affordable upgrade from a garbage nokia lumia 521. my only qualm is that it is extremely slow/unresponsive while charging. i can\\'t seem to find a fix. good quality this is my second windows phone, and i\\'m very happy with the quality and experience of this phone. the pictures are excellent. no need to buy the expensive brands. when trying to order an iphone 5 i was specifically looking for the cdma verizon version. the seller was very clear in his description and it was exactly what i was looking for. the phone was brand new, in the package still wrapped with all accessories as expected. the seller also provided the meid of the phone upon placing an order as to confirm that it was a clean esn. this also allowed me to check if the phone was compatible for straight talk in my area and it was. when i paid the extra couple dollars for expedited shipping it was upgraded to 2 day priority mail. i placed my order on wednesday and received my order the following friday. couldn\\'t ask for any more. it was just what i wanted and was actually cheaper than they said it would be. it was a couple of days later than i thought it would be. goog great phone, awesome camera ...you can take advantage of it with and app like camera fv5 and cinema fv5. the one which could have been great to have in my country was the a2003 due to radio frequencies specially 4g-lte still works good enough for me. just make sure you can get the one meeting your provider specs. the phone has many glitches!! i order the samsung s6 after switching from samsung s5 duos to ip6s+. the pucture quality of ip6s+ and the apps which need ma(p were linked to apple map) were so bad. i already gave my s5 away so s6 duos is better replacement. after turning it on and transferring the data from s5, i can have my old apps/note/sms. the display od s6 is so nice. quality of the picture is also nice. the only thing on my wish list is the micro sd slot. i hope it will come back in s7 this is the first smart phone i\\'ve owned, just getting out of the dinosaur age! it\\'s pretty easy to navigate through what i need to do on it. we purchased two of these, and so far have been great. we need to go through the tutorial someday to get the full benefits of the phone. great communication! exactly as stated. i\\'m happy. item did not meet my need, the item was defective when it said it was supose to be working fine. their hard to comunicate with, i would not buy from them again. traveled to the caribbean with this phone it worked great.great buy and quality no issues .highly recommend. exactly as described. super fast shipping. awesome this is an awesome phone for the price. the phone has decent memory without sd card inserted. takes nice pictures. sound is good. the home buttons glitch every now and then but that isn\\'t too bad. the build is in the good quality range, it\\'s well built. since we received the phone is been worth the money and time spent on it this product is bad and very defective, the phone stopped working after 3months of use and it was supposed to be a new phone,the screen went blank rendering it inoperable and no return policy ,so what do i do with the phone now? excellent. first of all the phone was advertised as a metro pcs phone but when i received it, it turned out to be a criket phone.false advertisement. second the phone was delivered without a phone battery or the back of the phone. i contacted seller and they said nothing was able to be done, and that i could not return it. god excelent! excellent! it works perfectly fine and is exactly what we reed on the descrption. thanks for your honesty. is in the best conditions. the deliver was on time. nothing bad to say. thank you very much. excelente i ordered this since it is mentioned unlocked. i ordered this to use outside us. unfortunately 3g is not supported there so i\\'m stuck with this phone only having edge. my recommendation is, if anyone intention to use this outside us please check that country 3g bands and make sure it is matching with the one mentioned in this phone. (4g hspa+ up to 21mbps 850/1700/1900) so i\\'ve no use this phone now and can\\'t be returned also. the phone shipped fast amd the free month of service was great! thank you! had a different boulder and it didn\\'t work well. so got this one and everything works well. i am very happy with the purchase. happy with the phone. excellent product great buy. excellent phone, amazing camera and works perfect 4g with movilnet and movistar in venezuela ... don\\'t doubt to buy this phone and arrived very quickly great start up phone with good specs and screen size. blu is highly recommended for a teen\\'s first phone. too big just got my iphone 5c. got it in 4 days. no problem. everything worked out great. would have been nice if the price was cheaper. but my recommendation is to spend that extra money and get a new one, i don\\'t trust the old ones.the only con with this purchase was the headphones are crap and knock off. didn\\'t even work properly. the phone charger/adapter also is not apple. but i already have plenty of those so it didn\\'t matter. that is the only reason why i didn\\'t given 5/5 stars. overall very satisfied good phone, but not satisfy with the camera. good value for price and performance. apart from the way out right position of the back key, the unit well worth it. just be sure to buy a decent sized memory card. caution when purchasing this phone. not bluetooth compatible (at least with my previously compatible s4), no gps. written on the box european sim only. the phone has a nice screen and probably a better processor other than that is not that much better than the s4 but considerable bigger than a mini should be. i want a mini to be mini. unfortunate i\\'m a gadget person and wanted this unit for a long time now. i\\'m a little disappointed. well, back to the s4 i go. im quite disappointed to say i order a new phone and it look like a refurbish phone, the battery cover look like it not for the phone, a see part of the side phone done getting away, i had used a pearl 8100 and a 8320 and when loading i see blackberry or o2 but this one i seeing some kind of mtn not sure anyone have this problem with it, and the pre loaded theme not like i know of other bb phone and next time when pass had on the screen feeling all the edge plus it screen didnot come with a plastic covering like i know all new phone come with.plus i have a problem not the phone not reading the memory card, sometime ago i check on the inside and i really look used the pin that inside back of phone not corresponding with with phone actually used, it look like a waste of money so i vex. i love it. i dont think this phone is realy 3g because i had a 3g before this one and it picked up fine but this one does not pick up as good. but on the other hand it is a good phone it is perfect... love this case! i know my phone will be protected and really like the colors! great phone. bought as gift for a friend in venezuela, i went there, gave it to her and a few days later i came back... and she started having problems with the phone... battery drained fast, purchased another brand new original battery, same problem, phone started to restart itself every moment. because i am an electronics tech and had business over there repairing cell phones for more than 6 years, i advised her to take it to a friend\\'s repair facility and just insert the diagnostic tester device, to speak simple. phone had a problem that involved the internal power supply and the esn micro chip. she sent it back to the states, paid for the shipping, and when i tried to contact the company that sold it, they never answer. money waisted, and lost. the phone went to the trash bin. not original do not get it phone is great no problems with that. sims card is the problem and sprint is the biggest problem on getting one. not the phone guys problem but sprint is just a pain to deal with period. finally after 2 weeks of fighting with sprint they are sending me a new sims card. i had no problems with the seller. it worked for my kitty wireless cellular service! bought bb 9900 but received bb 9930 but love the phone wow! two phone numbers (two sim cards) on one small phone! everything about this phone is outstanding. i am very happy and content with my first i phone. a friend recommodated to me and it\\'s above my expertations.so know enjoy evert day the bennefits of this product. the only thing that im worry about its that the cel trends to overheat too fast... just with two minutes of continuous use! but, to be fair, its not that hot. this phone has a nice facial design but its carbage. please do not invest ur hard money in this s***. 1) no perminent signal. you won\\'t get signal if u driving no receive calls. i downloaded a apps to boost signal but nada. can\\'t connect to home wifi which is 3ft away from phone and when i get 2 connected internet. takes all year to go online. this is phone is trash. don\\'t throw ur money away. greatly designed phone.fast, beautiful, elegant phonestereo speakers made the phone to work nicer than any other one in the market in terms of playing videos and music using the built-in speakers.excellent sound using the headphones (i have beats headphones) and they sound really similar to them. difference is not noticeable. (maybe there are \"hidden\" beats, who knows)one thing you should knowi is that it comes with android 4.4.2 and this os has a restriction using the memory card (mmc) this is a google thing not the phone\\'s, so that is why i did not lower the rating. passing files to the memory card from the internal memory is not allowed unless the application installed has permissions to write to the mmc. i had to root the phone and modify the permissions to remove this restriction. good phone, need more time to grasp features. the sony compact series has always been my go to for an android phone because of the size and speed. the previous compacts were based on the latest and greatest highest end chip set at the time of their releases. when this phone was announced as having the sd 650, i was more than disappointed so i wrote the phone off. i wasn\\'t sure which phone to get so i bought an iphone 7 which lasted a couple weeks until i remembered how restricted ios was. i then had three options for a smallish phone. the honor 8.. still a little large, the google pixel.. expensive! and the sony x compact. i had all three within about a month. i kept the x compact. yep that\\'s right. i gave up the greatest from google and a very premium made honor 8. the reason?number 1-the feel and size are just right. its just a joy to use and carry.number 2- i immediately realized that this phone is just as fast as the z5 compact and i\\'m not sure what they did but this phone is silky smooth, almost iphone like. you have some hang ups like every other android like in the play store but overall i am really impressed with the performance. that just shows that specs are not everything and there is something to be said for real optimization.number - 3 price. it was dropped to $399 when i bought mine. compared to the pixel, it\\'s half the price.i\\'m no camara guru so i can\\'t really speak on this too much but it does take some real nice shots in good light. low light will not be the best.many people are bashing because the phone isn\\'t waterproof but it doesn\\'t bother me.*edit. it\\'s frustrating when someone gives one star and is not even talking about this phone!! the x compact does not have a cover for the usb!!!! this proves that the reviewer is ignorant. amazon needs to monitor these reviews better!! led screen went out after three weeks of use. excellent seller and products and very nice battery doesn\\'t stand long even when mobile is not in use..... did not get earpiece with the phone i love the phone but was disappointed that i didn\\'t receive earphones with phone everything was ok :) wife likes it i had the iphone 6 before, i decided to upgrade to the 6s plus. im happy i purchased it and i cant see myself going back to the 4.7 inch iphone anymore. the 5.5 inch screen is perfect for my needs. it took sometime getting used to the bigger size, but i adapted to it quickly. the charger does not work great seller took back quickly. phone like many won\\'t work it\\'s a version problem always buy things from amazon directly, they are responsable and everything always arrive fast and just like you ordered, excellent cell phone, the only down is the camera wich has no good resolution and no flash, but the rest ist ok i bought the phone because the seller said it was unlocked, then i went to a store to buy a sim card, they said the phone is locked, its asking for a pin code it was not provided also i was not advided from the seller the phone did not come with the charger. i am not satisfied and i am returning the item. nice i like this phone has never worked rite from the start. it freezes up and will barely run on the internet. i was wonderin if yall would be willin to fix it. id pay a teasonable price to have it fixed i purchased this phone as an upgrade to my blackberry passport. the phone is made very well and feels like a quality product including the nostalgic qwerty keyboard.if you plan on using this phone and tie it into your blackberry server the bb interface is on par with the previous bb hub in bb10.unfortunately my company decided to no longer support bb once the last bb os phone dies and i had to move to good.i had very high expectations of this phone from blackberry merging their security, features with the android os and app availability.the os does what every android phone does but i noticed bugs quite frequent. the lack of a fingerprint scanner is annoying if you use good instead of bes12 or use other applications that will require a second sign in. i preferred to use the on screen keyboard most of the time as typing is much faster. i attempted to use the keyboard for scrolling and keep away from smudges and fingerprints but the screen response to keyboard swipes is very jerky and not fluid at all. don\\'t buy todo perfectamente bien.. recomendado 100% samsung has one of the worst customer service i have dealt with. have had the galaxy s7 for less than a year and started crapping out on me by slowing down and constantly closing down programs. talked with the customer service which was rude and apathetic. sent in the phone to their repair center in a plano texas. apparently it was a battery issue and they \"repaired\" it. they sent back phone and i received it completely damaged. the screen was completely inked out. they initially wanted to blame ups but there was no apparent damage to the box or packaging. they finally owned up to the damage but was completely unhelpful with going about resolving the issue. they had the audacity to say normally i would be charged to fix the screen they damaged. i am completely done with samsung and all their products that apparently either malfunctioning or blowing up. if you need a simple phone for talking and texting, this id the phone for you! it also takes decent pictures. when my first nokia c3 finally died, i went on a search for another one because i loved it so much. you can\\'t find better battery life. it\\'s simple to use. i don\\'t need all of the fancy stuff, so it\\'s perfect for me. very user friendly! on the occasion of the testimony of my short experience with this phone, in order to serve someone else and if it is possible that the manufacturer improve its products, i make this review.pros:the phone is fairly light weightgood appearanceqwerty very pleasant to operate, good size keys that reduces any possibility of error by typingthe appearance and form are very strikingmessages and phone calls very solid, no noisecons:the operating system is relatively poor. for example, i included music by ovi and after a while i wanted to remove, it was practically impossible without leaving a trace on the phone. in various parts of your rankings are the same song, which does not seem bad to me, however, when you delete a song or albums are traces of the deleted song impossible to remove pointing errors. even restoring the track to choose another way to delete does not mean that it ceases to occur. ovi software and the phone in this regard is poor. i have chosen to avoid including applications, songs, etc. than the original settings, trying to avoid filling up your mistakes erased. compare this procedure to include and delete songs from your computer using itunes or from my ipod touch directly.thanks. amazing!!! phone last long, and have great battery life. have always loved nokia phones and this one is no exception, as long as it makes calls i\\'m fine worked perfectly right out the box. no problems. as described by seller. broke in the 1st week i\\'ve had the blu energy x for two weeks now. i have to say it\\'s not the best blu phone i have had, but it\\'s got its perks.pros:~good battery. not the best (i miss my studio energy, wanted the studio energy 2 but out of my budget) but it gets me from sunup to sundown.~android 5.1. amazing. great features.~seems to me that i can store more apps on my sd card versus other android phones i\\'ve owned.cons:~very glitchy. i\\'ve had to restart the phone several times because apps would crash and not open.~it took about seven times to download certain apps.~1 gb ram is really not enough to run everything i want.~phone is slow to call. i hit call button and it takes several seconds to show that it made the call. also the phone rings for 5-8 seconds before the screen pops up to let me answer.i\\'ll be keeping this phone, but as soon as i can i\\'ll be getting the studio energy 2. good afternoonthe reason i write it is that on monday i received here in venezuela the requested product, the problem is that when you open and use the sensor jostick or middle ball is damaged or does not move one way or another and not to want to serve i would like to know that solution can give the product as the request indicated that it was me again and i came with this defect.regardsjohn king came as claimed. near flawless condition... i couldn\\'t find anything wrong with it if i tried. only thing is it came with a black back piece of aluminum... no apple logo or and writing, at all. but it grew on me its very sleek. phone operates as expected and is lightning fast. i would suggest to anyone. it\\'s better than what i was expecting i love it. great job nokia and microsoft. !!!!!!!! freezes alot. best iphone yet i got this phone 2 days ago and its alright, i only say that because i hate blackberrys and its my first one & i downgraded from an iphone to this. so the contrast is hard for me. this phone is running on 4.6 and i tried everything possible to bring it up to os 5 and i cant. it tells me its up to date ughhh, is anyone else having this issue? great cellphone great condition perfect cellphone everything is working fine it\\'s been a long time since i have a great condition cellphone it is an uncomplicated cell phone that will fit in a pocket very nicely. i love the simplicity and it meets my daily cell phone requirments. the item description said \"new\" if that was the case then the piece at the top of the phone would not be coming off. if i wanted a used phone i would have bought one. will not be ordering from this company in the future. disappointed. when i opened the bb cell phone in the back inside part it had sulphate in several places. i have used it and it seems to work ok but why did it have sulphate inside ? i think it was not new and i had ordered a new cell phone. comes locked to at&t. thankfully, it\\'s super easy to unlock a legit model number on at&t\\'s website and it works great. this phone is great. i have been using is for 3 mths now.it is unlocked as described and all you need to do is provide the sim card. it works very well and it is fast. it can play most games and other applications. i like that it has a lot of space as i download a lot of stuff.i have rather big hands and the keyboard on the screen is big enough to accommodate my fingers without making too many mistakes. the screen being big is also a good thing since it makes things such as text easier to see so you can do other things such as reading a book for example.the 8 mp camera takes great clear photos and the video isn\\'t bad either.it comes with android gingerbread (v 2.3) but with the samsung keis software you can easily upgrade the phone to jellybean (v 4.1.2)what i don\\'t like about this phone is the the battery life is very poor. satisfied perfect fit. quick delivery. i received this damaged. it didn\\'t turn on or charged and i couldn\\'t even return it because i am in ecuador. such a waste of money. really impressed with the quality of the phone; very easy to set up and add a plan. i would definitely recommend this retailer to anyone interested in purchasing a phone from the retailer and will definitely purchase my next one from them. thanks! the phone looks brand new!! no scratches or scuffs. my son loved it and there was no problem with the activation. excelente bought this for my father and in less than a month it stopped working out of the blue. is the second blu phone he has owned that has stopped working, i don\\'t recommend this brand to anyone. don\\'t waste your money. i love this phone this is an awesome phone if you are using a no-contract service like net-10 or straight talk. not the best, but definitely competitive against other big brand phones for this price. do you need the best? probably not. get this instead. very nice phone. i also bought sandisk 200gb and it works great. great condition. exactly as described. i ordered this phone from the seller above in july and received it promptly (before the weekend hit, though it was expected to arrive on monday. awesome!) and in great condition. the phone had no scratches or dents & worked flawlessly.but months later in november the phone simply stopped working. it randomly cut off and hasn\\'t come back on.mind you this isn\\'t the seller\\'s fault but be very aware of the common issues this phone can have! i loved it, but very disappointed to have it die after a few months of regular usage. it also died a month after htc\\'s warranty ran out, so it appears getting a new model is my only option. i have the samsung galaxy note 10.1. this case fits perfectly. it protects my tablet all around. a must have!!with the tablet in place, the main case itself measures 7 1/2\" from top to bottom by 10 1/2\" from side to side.when fully covered (2-pc case), it measures 11\" length x 8\" width.it is specifically made for the 10.1\" n8000 samsung galaxy note phone/tablet with stylus. it is an awesome case offering great protection for this tablet.(but if you have anything other than the note tablet i just described, do not get, it will not fit.)love love love ***** i love these phones. i have even turned my husband on the the brand. it is a great phone for the price. the phone look like a new phone. been using it for almost a month and no problem. the camera is bad. :/ excellent product excelente very good value for the price. this phone simple to understand and great to use all good! works okay for a gift. garbage did not last long verry. good👍 this phone is a starter phone those who are not used to smart phones. very flimsy and slow. not the phone for tech savvy people. thanks j&r. good service, phone works, my son has no problem with it. i had a expectations very low for this, but for 50 dollars, its good. i liked that comes with case and screen protector ... only, i found something big, i thought it was smaller this used phone came not being able to read the sim card!!!! i call this fraud!! it is wrong!! i want my $60 back its not right great phone with 2 issues, gps does not lock in to location, battery life is not good. i\\'m really happy i chose this phone instead of the galaxy s5.i used to have a galaxy s4 and now that i have this one i can really appreciate the difference when holding the phone: this one feels sturdy and made of quality materials, unlike the plastic feeling you get when holding most other phones.the interface is simple and elegant, without the extra apps that samsung puts as part of their os, making android run very smoothly. the only thing i miss from my old s4 is the option of swiping over a contact to make a phone call or send a message directly, but otherwise i would pick this cleaner android version over samsung\\'s every time.the camera is not the best. it takes nice low light pictures (a lot better than the s4) but otherwise the colors are just not as bright and pictures don\\'t have as much detail (4 \"ultrapixels\" is just not enough). if you care a lot about taking pictures with your phone and cropping them afterwards, this is not the phone for you.if you are not into taking photos, but care a lot about having a durable and nice looking phone, running android smoothly without the overloaded, kind of clunky interface of the galaxy sx (heart rate monitor... really??), this is definitely the phone for you and i can guarantee you will never even notice the \"missing\" features when comparing it to the s5. excellent was a brand new card but it wasn\\'t for my phone great phone!!. great service from the seller. nice phone, great value, i was looking for an iphone, but didnt want to pay $300 or $400 for a newer version, so i went with this 3gs. it arrived in like new condition with all the features of the iphone for a much more affordable price. great this has been the smoothest phone i have ever had. it really only lags when i end up not paying attention to how many tabs i have open in chrome (really man, 24 tabs, you can close a few of those). otherwise it runs like a champ has an all day battery and with the marshmallow update, it is just getting better. this phone is very nice.it has a nice 5 inch screen and is pretty slim and light. the speed is also very good for the price paid, reminds me of an s3. the cameras work good, and the wife is great, i was able to skype with no issues.it comes in a very nice giftable box, and really looks like its worth a lot more then the $140 i paid.i use it on at&t, and it worked out of the box with no issues. it took about 5 minutes to download all my apps and start chatting on whatsapp. i am really liking this phone. i read some reviews where people did not think the screen is bright enough but it is alright with me. it is difficult to see in bright sunlight. the speaker is not the best for listening to music but i do enjoy listening to radio stations. if i want to listen to music for an extended period i use my earbuds anyway. i especially like the dual active sim. i probably won\\'t use that capability often but it is nice to have it. for the price i really don\\'t know what else you could expect. 4 gigabytes of ram with 64 gigabytes of storage unlocked for $300. case fits very nicely..complete phone coverage...the most sturdy casing material i have ever felt or seen. looking forward to putting this through the paces. it sucks worse phone i\\'ve ever had, froze every time i got a phone call and is only a 2g, didn\\'t realize how old is was till i got it splendid item. it met my expectation. the cell works well, however for some reason the charging is a problem. i have to charge while cell is off and it doesn\\'t always work. i have to turn cell off and on several times before it will actually charge. i don\\'t recommend this cell, their are so many more better cells than this one. keep shopping. this phone sucks and it wnt let me use it with out wifi and wnt let me send pic messages and have done everything they told me to do and still is not working at all and would like another phone or something good quality, good price. working good.. does everything i want a cell phone to do and it came packaged in original box and looked like it was never used. great phone! if you\\'re looking for a great budget friendly phone, can\\'t go wrong here! great build quality and features. however once i updated to android m, i lost some key features such as motorola assist. :( boo! works like a champ. exactly the way i wanted it. i recently bought an iphone 4s from this seller. when it arrived it looked fine. we went to verizon to set it up- and here is where the problem started. the camera light would not turn off, the tech said that\\'s a sign of water damage and it was literally draining the battery at very rapid rate. i booked a genius bar appointment at apple to see if it could be fixed. when they opened up the phone they discovered it has been tampered with, voiding the warranty and the light was not repairable.contacted the seller who sent us another iphone 4s. potential buyers read this: given our issue with the last phone we booked another apple store appointment just to have the phone checked out. it\\'s even worse this time around, the apple tech said it had been tampered with and cautioned us to get rid of the phone as soon as possible. when i pushed him for details on what was wrong with the phone, he said the phone had been tampered with to the point that it can be used for identity theft, basically opening any accounts used on the phone and getting account information- he wasn\\'t supposed to tell us this but thank god he did! almost everyone i know has a banking app or email with very private information.no matter how much it ends up costing you, do not buy from this seller. i\\'m fairly certain all of the positive reviews are from people who are none the wiser and never had their phones inspected by an apple tech. remember that it takes over a year to get your identity back if its stolen, not worth it for a used iphone. excelente equipo, lo recomiendo a quienes desean tener un buen equipo por mucho tiempo, es lo mejor que bb ha tirado al mercado. my sole purpose of this purchase was to use this phone as a small form factor android media player that i can listen to spotify music thru blue-tooth headphones while i am in the gym or running. with this setup i am completely satisfied with the size and operation of this device.pros-1) small form factor2) runs on andriod3) price4) battery life5) prompt tech-supportcons-1) i received a non-english version of the phone. the firmware had to be flashed with an english version. tech-support sent out how-to instructions along with links for the firmware, drivers, and installation tool. it took several tries but i was finally able to flash the phone to english. bear that in mind if you decide to get the phone and come up with my situation.2) small keyboard - i dread having to type anything on this phone.3) special micro usb charging cable - this cable has a longer male jack. due to the way the phone jack is designed, a regular micro usb cable is too short to fully insert in so it will not charge. you will have to use the provided usb cable that came with it which is annoying because it is extra gear you need to take with you bought this phone in august 2014, december 2014 the charge port quit working and by march 2015 the microphones failed as well. i like the look of the phone and the software is great for the price. the main thing is read the fine print if you plan on buying the phone and having it repaired by blu warranty service. you have to send your phone to them in miami and wait forever to hear anything back from their customer service. they claim repairs only take 10-15 days, but it has been over a month since i sent my phone to them and still have not got it back....my point is whether you buy this device or any blu device be prepared for poor customer service when it has issues. it\\'s not the best the battery don\\'t last as long as it should this phone sucksit can\\'t run any games and it is always delayed when i type or when i scroll and every once in awhile the phone just doesn\\'t want to charge the main reason i chose this phone was speed, and s6 has that in spades. i write software for a living and tried many things to keep my old phone fast, yet despite sticking with android 2.3.3 and refusing to update apps or install much of anything, web browsing had become an act of click a link and wait 1-5 minutes for it to load, then the screen would stall repeatedly as i tried to scroll through to read the page. if i had to click another link, the waiting process began again. although other apps on the phone were reasonably fast, web sites had bloated enough that browsing was intolerable with a phone released in 2010 and many sites would not function correctly unless i updated the browser and made things even slower. the same sites on s6 work great, are nearly instant to load, and there\\'s no lag at any time. it\\'s amazing.i went from a google g1 to g2 (htc vision) because i didn\\'t want to lose a physical keyboard, but i\\'m happy to say that the screen on the s6 is so large that i have no problem typing accurately without a physical keyboard. the screen clarity and resolution are insane. some big-name reviewers claim there\\'s no point in having so much resolution, but it\\'s really a joy to see tiny, clear labels with extra info in various apps, to look at photos with absolutely no pixelation, and to remote-control other computer screens with no loss of detail. the s6 at 2560x1440 pixels has more resolution than my desktop monitor at 1920x1200!the camera is even more impressive with its 5312x2988 max resolution. it\\'s got enough res to virtually zoom in to 8x during photo or video recording without complete loss of detail. the camera beats my canon vixia hf100 1080p camcorder by a mile with better resolution and much more detail in the lightest and darkest areas. big review sites say this is pretty much the best phone camera on the market and it\\'s nice to always have a good camera with you for unexpected shots. even the focus speed is far faster than the camcorder and the phone has a built-in ability to do awesome things like stitching panoramic shots together as you pan the phone across a landscape or taking shots with multiple focus points and combining them to make everything clear. of course the camcorder can still zoom farther with optical zoom to catch distant wildlife so the phone isn\\'t a complete replacement for it.review sites consistently say the big negatives on the s6 are its battery and its delicate glass and aluminum construction. the construction can be fixed with a case like\\xa0spigen capsule ultra rugged, but i was surprised to find the battery can also be fixed with a few tweaks that weren\\'t mentioned by all those big professional review sites. during the phone\\'s initial setup screens i chose to set up a google account, but did not set up a samsung account or enable any samsung features it gave options for. i also declined sending usage/diagnostic info to samsung or google. the first night i went to bed with the phone fully charged and pretty much only stock software installed and it was down to 56% the next morning. terrible! using settings > applications > application manager, i disabled the following apps and battery drain went from around 44% that first night to 3% the next night!ant radio service, ant+ plugins service, briefing, dropbox, facebook, gmail, google partner setup, google play books, google play games, google play movies & tv, google play music, google play newstand, google+, hangouts, instagram, live weather, memo, onedrive, photo screensavers, print spooler, s health, s voice, samsung galaxy, samsung link platform connect, theme store, virtual tour, weather daemonbased on what i\\'ve read, these are all safe apps to disable. in fact, unless you root the phone, i don\\'t think the phone will let you disable anything unsafe because the disable button was greyed out on about half the things i looked at. now i don\\'t know which of the above apps are the real battery hogs, so if you see something up there you actually want to use, hopefully it won\\'t kill your battery to enable it. the phone also comes with a \"smart manager\" app where you can click \"ram\", then \"manage apps\" tab and set particular apps to be killed 10 minutes after the screen is turned off. so if you find a particular app is killing your idle battery, adding it to the list might help. it doesn\\'t look like you can add any of the stock software to the \"auto stop\" list, unfortunately, but maybe if some of the things above were enabled they would appear on the list.over the next few days i installed all my usual apps, including avast! antivirus which i was worried about, and the phone remains blazing fast and still loses almost nothing with the screen off. in fact i think it was 73% when i went to bed and 73% when i got up this morning. batteries don\\'t lose power linearly so it doesn\\'t seem unreasonable that it\\'s sticking in the 70s.i kind of wish they\\'d have given it a larger battery anyway, since most of its competitors have larger batteries, but that would have added to the weight and for my use, the current battery seems to be more than enough. i don\\'t go out a lot or spend much time using my phones, but when i do have a bit of down time, it will be nice to browse the web without the horrible lag. the other thing that worries me is previous phone batteries have always swollen after 2-3 years and forced me to replace them. this is mostly due to bad phone hardware not limiting the battery charge so extra current just gradually damages and swells the battery. i eventually worked around it using tasker to turn the charger on/off using an x10 module and keep the phone between 70-80% charge. i\\'ve had zero swollen batteries since then and will do the same thing with the s6. but for those that always leave it on the charger to keep it at 100% most of the time, i\\'m worried the battery will swell and crack the glass back of the phone. hopefully samsung has set the charger system up to prevent that but it was a big problem with my last two phones. i recommend trying not to leave the phone near 100% charge just in case.another reason i wish they\\'d put in a bigger battery is that the phone would be thicker and they wouldn\\'t need to leave the camera sticking out of the back. having the camera like that is ridiculous and forces everyone to buy a case that protrudes enough to protect the camera from slapping down on a hard surface and cracking. that camera is definitely by biggest fear when it comes to damaging this phone and i\\'m sorely tempted to buy a case that covers the back with thick rubber right up to near the edge of the camera. yet that ruins the beauty of the phone\\'s back so the camera design just sucks. i\\'ve never bothered with cases on my previous phones because i so rarely drop them, although they\\'ve each survived a few falls over the years, but the s6 looks so fragile i ended up using\\xa0spigen neo hybrid ex\\xa0to give it some protection and to prevent the camera from contacting a table surface when the phone is on its back. the case has feet at all four corners that give it enough thickness to prevent the camera touching, but if any of the small feet end up off the table the camera still touches, which is annoying. i had to add extra padding to\\xa0choetech qi wireless charging pad\\xa0to keep the camera from scraping on it.if you do need a bigger battery there are cases you can buy with a battery built in. such cases do add weight and usually block the wireless charging ability of the phone, though it would make sense if they developed a battery case that could charge itself wirelessly.fast charging:i doubt i\\'ll use it much, but the phone comes with a special \"adaptive fast charger\" that will take the phone from 5% to about 50% in 30 minutes by dumping in 9v instead of the usual 5v. charging speed is reduced the closer the phone gets to full. the fast charger is supposed to detect what it\\'s connected to and operate at 5v on normal devices, but i read that someone plugged it in to a ps4 controller and fried the controller. they repeated the experiment 3 more times (dishonestly returning the broken controllers to the store to exchange for new ones) and it happened every time. of course, maybe the guy was lying to get attention or had a defective fast charger, but he sounded serious so i figured i\\'d pass on the warning not to risk using the fast charger on anything other than the phone.wireless charging:samsung seems to have put its charging coil at a slightly non-standard height in the phone because every upright wireless charger i looked at had complaints that the s6 would only charge on its side or upside down. the choetech charger i link above had the fewest complaints, but the phone still doesn\\'t always link with it in the upright position. interestingly, when i added the spidgen bumper \"case\" to the phone, it connects to the charger with pretty much 100% reliability so maybe samsung had their thinking cap on assuming almost nobody would use the phone without a case and they positioned the charging coil so it\\'s appropriate only with a case. still, i think the coil is barely within alignment tolerances and so the phone charges slowly. also note that although i\\'ve seen sellers of wireless chargers claim they can \"fast charge\" the phone, the charging coil in the phone is not physically able to take in power as quickly as the 9v wired fast charger can put out. in fact, i\\'ve seen complaints that wireless charging can\\'t always keep up with the amount of power this phone uses to play video or do other things with the screen on. i have a feeling that\\'s because the charging coils aren\\'t aligning well and/or the phone hasn\\'t been tweaked to limit the amount of background crap it\\'s constantly doing with some apps.rooting:samsung has special hardware protection that will permanently mark your phone as compromised if you root it using most methods, though there are some ways around it. when your phone gets marked, they call it \"blowing the knox fuse\" and supposedly if that happens you can\\'t use samsung pay and your warranty might be voided. i\\'ve rooted my previous two phones but haven\\'t generally found the extra \"powers\" to be useful so i\\'m leaning towards leaving the s6 stock.thumb-print scanner:this is a very cool way of protecting your phone from unwanted users, although it\\'s really a false sense of security. it will likely guard against friends or family mucking with your phone, but a thief (or a techie friend/family) can reboot the phone holding power, volume up, and home button to enter a bootloader mode where they can overwrite the boot loader and get at the phone\\'s data. so the thumb scanner and the \"find lost device\" features might slow or stop someone who doesn\\'t know what they\\'re doing, but a real thief will turn off the phone as soon as they have it and never boot it to let you find it again. anyway, the thumb scanner itself is decent but i seem to hit it at the wrong angle at least a third of the time and have to carefully move my thumb to be perfectly straight and centered on the scanner. i thought maybe if i moved my thumb to various slight angles and off center during thumb print training it might help but it seemed to make it worse. then i thought maybe i could set up three versions of my thumb - straight on, slightly left, slightly right - but you can only program four finger prints total. so i trained it for both my thumbs and one index plus one for my wife. it\\'s a disappointing limitation. using the thumb scanner is reasonably fast when it works, but it feels slower than a simple pattern i used with my old phone, so i\\'m not sure if i\\'ll stick with it.you can wake the phone by pressing the thumb scanner button but if you don\\'t lift your thumb off and put it back down after pressing the button, it never scans it as a valid thumb print. this is very annoying. we also discovered that if you fail to scan your thumb too many times, the phone locks down and _requires_ you to type the backup password. i\\'m not sure how many failed attempts turn on lockdown, but my wife caused it to happen on a trip when she repeatedly unlocked the phone to take photos. if you don\\'t have your unlock password memorized and it\\'s written on a paper at home, this could ruin a trip. this \"feature\" is even more annoying in that it doesn\\'t say the phone has disabled the thumb scanner. instead it shows the normal lock screen but when you put your thumb down it does nothing - no unlock and no vibrate to indicate it didn\\'t recognize your thumb. i thought maybe my thumb scanner had broken but after typing the unlock password it\\'s worked fine for days.in \"settings > lock screen and security > secure lock settings > smart lock\" you can enable other methods of unlocking the phone. these include saying \"ok google\" in your voice, having the phone at a particular known gps location, having the phone paired to a trusted bluetooth device (car, watch, etc), or having the phone up against an nfc (near field communication) sticker. of course, if you tell the phone to remain unlocked when near your watch, and a thief demands your watch and your phone, well... you can also tell the phone not to lock as long as you\\'re holding it or have it in your pocket. i have no idea how it knows when you\\'re holding it or have it in your pocket, but the description of the feature claims it knows that somehow.\"gold\" vs \"platinum gold\" color:the amazon listing shows a choice of gold vs platinum gold color. i picked \"gold\" and was excited to finally be getting a gold phone, but the box that arrived showed \"platinum gold\". argh! researching online, it appears the s6 is only made in 3 colors: black, white, and platinum gold. so the \"gold\" option on amazon is a mistake. the phone has a hint of gold to it in certain lights but most of the time it looks silver and the gold tone is never more than subtle.overall an amazing phone. screen and camera quality are perfect. my only complaints are smaller than average battery and the camera that sticks out the back. for my uses, the battery size doesn\\'t matter. if i ever crack the camera due to its ridiculous sticky-outy design, i\\'ll probably come back and knock a couple stars, but for now i\\'m happy. excelente loving my blu i was sold a bad cell the phone was and is as described. the price was a smoking deal, and i could not be happier. pictures bad internet terrible would not buy this pnone for any thing other than texting or calls but have be close to tower for good calls. never work right. returned. great use for international travel it works perfectly outside of us. got this phone for a friend, simple easy to use for someone wanting simple with out all the extras, just a basic phone very good product, i recommend purchase, works very well in venezuela the phone itself is great but the software contains a bug that drains the battery fast even while it\\'s asleep. apparently the bug causes the phone not to enter sleep properly and also a bug dealing with wifi scanning. sony is suppose to provide a fix at some point. i like the phone so much that i would like to deal with it until the update but the bug is so bad that i don\\'t think that\\'s possible. for example, my phone had around 55-65% left and after 8 hours of absolutely no use, the battery was completely dead. even using temporary fixes people provide online couldn\\'t alleviate the problem for me. i\\'m disappointed that i am going to have to return and look for something else because it has a great screen, takes fabulous pictures, speaker is loud but sounds a little \"tin-y\" and seems to be the perfect size i\\'m looking for in a phablet. the white option for this phone makes it look sick as well. the only things i would change is have the volume rocker more towards the top of the phone on the side instead of in the middle on the side, move the on/off button to the top of the phone. moving these would make it easier to use and would make finding a car mount easier. have a user replaceable battery, and have the phone charge faster (they advertise that it\\'s a fast charge, but coming from a samsung note 4, it\\'s far from a fast charge. might have to buy a different charger to accomplish that). and fix the battery drain bug asap.update: if anyone has purchased this phone and is dealing with the battery drain issue, i have been able to decrease the battery drain by installing the app: 360 battery plus and also turning off wifi scanner in the settings menu. this seems to have made the issue more tolerable if you decide to keep the phone until sony fixes it. hope this helps you like it did for me. amazing came exactly on my birthday thank you. when i bought this phone, it arrived packaged as new, and it worked and looked fine with no problems. however, it came with ios 7.1.1, which is rather confusing since that os came out more than 2 years after the phone did. when i questioned the seller about it, they said that it was updated by apple before they liquidated the phone off to the seller. since i had specifically wanted it to have the original ios, i returned it without any hassle.tl;dr - if you want the original ios, don\\'t buy this phone. i was pleased with the product and it\\'s functions. it\\'s very responsive and light weight. i have big hand and i sometimes forget and i block the mic on the bottom. product exactly as advertised excellent not very good i am buying these for the two landlines i transferred to t-mobile. i have a personal cell spot so reception is superb in my house. however, the phone seemed to drop connection when not being used. when i click on call button to turn on the screen, i often see the connections of both lines in emergency or unavailable status. but then will connect to tmo after a a few seconds. the call quality is spotty at best. when i take the phone to a starbucks next door, the phone lost cell signals.so, the phone is kind of in working condition in my house and seemed to be useless when traveling. i am giving it 3 stars since it works sometimes in my house and does what i need for now. the radio and flashlights are also good features if i don\\'t use it as a phone long term. i got the phone blocked and now i have to pay $50 to unlock it. just love it i purchased this phone almost a month ago. i was a bit skeptical at first to try it, because of some other reviews i saw. i decided to give this phone a try anyway, just to go with my own instinct. i am very glad i did. the nokia c6 is a wonderful touchscreen phone. this is my third nokia and i must say that i have never been let down by the brand. i pretty much love everything about this phone. the phone is amazing but the charger put with it did not work. i had a s2 lite before. this s4 is pretty good. i do recommend. good works perfectly 😀😀😀 sister loves it. item is just like it says. works well with at&t. good and working i would never buy this phone. its very hard to type a text. my fingers are small and still struggled to type the intended letter. battery doesnt last long and with hardly using it. exelente returned but bought iphone 6 plus buy the phone that was not what i reach my destination i bought the 7582 and came als model 7562 i expect a prompt solution. she loves the phone but it has a bad charger and i have yet to hear back from them and i\\'m not happy about it. the battery drains out quickly, remaining features are good. it has everything i need from a smartphone plus the great look and feel of the htc sense and the phone design.battery lasts 1 day with use and i get close to 2 days with no intensive use of camera and calls and without 4g (only wireless).this is my third htc phone and i think will not be the last one. the phone is pretty quick and responsive, it doesnt have any lags or crashes with any apps so far.totally recomended for a person that wants to buy an android phone, htc has the best android phones! nice phone. i plan to return this item because, shortly after received, the navegation ball did not work well. i do not know what caused this nor do i know if the item was actually a refurbished instead of a new one as i had ordered. hooked up to service and works great! the person who sold this to me had to take it back. presumably it was unlocked by att, but tethering remained locked. excellent product 100% recommended very good thanks for all your kind attention to quality poor quality. before i bought this one i owned 3 of these evos, so yes i am hard on them. after a couple week the touch screen began to act funny. eventually i was more of a headache using it than not having a phone. this is a great phone but don\\'t buy it here. el telefono se considera bueno con sus aplicaciones para un uso normal. en realidad satisface las espectativas. viene desbloqueado y funciona con cualquier operador. it\\'s my first purchase of a cellular internet , this wine with microphone problems and dirty, but said that she looked like was not so new . i like it for the operating system you have. the chassis of the phone is very vulnerable, although the display supports many hits . perfect fantastic phone defective damaged power button and battery back beautiful the phone and solved the problem with the release ... responsible people form very very fast and easy resolved the problem the thank recommend first week awesome after that phone would lose charge fast and soon stopped charging all together ok excelent phone! excelent features! the version that came to me was the chinese version of the phone (it came without the cyanogenmod logo and with the charger included 😀) with the chinese version of cyanogenmod 11 rom. anyway i was able to flash the latest american version of cyanogenmod 11s! 100% recommended! good phone, powerfull, low price!!!!! i like this phone i got what i want i liked keypad and touch both and it has all i want i love this watch cell phone e smart.it connect with my cell phone without no problem.love ittttttt.... very nice well taken care of phone.... works great! it arrived ok does not work well!!! does not receive messages, does not notify, does not allow for calls, etc. in order for it to function, you need to take out the phone which defeats the purpose of the watch. do not recommend! my wife has had this phone for several years, at the beginning using the apps was super fast and the battery could easily go for two maybe three days. then for the last several months it started to last only for 10 hours, using apps would be sluggish, and the phone would overheat.verizon looked at it and replaced it with a referb phone, it too had the same issues.thinking that if i could have a phone like it i could reconfigure it to work like it use to, then i could also fix my wifes. my mistake, after buying this phone for myself and spending two weeks with it i\\'ve decided it is a lost cause. looking on the web i\\'ve found several post indicating that it\\'s last upgrade to android 4.1.2 is a likely cause and the system developers have thrown in the towel in trying to resolve the issues.i guess if i could have rooted the phone and revert it to an earlier android version then it may be ok. but i had to stop and just bought both of us a moto x no contract. exactly what i wanted, and got here quickly. thanks. nice phone with all the necessary smart features with reasonable price range.body is little delicate but if you use good cover there should no be issue. thanks again phone does not work and it was never reset the software cant be returned to original software is a scammer levanta 4g ,un sr telefono i have to give this phone a perfect rating. considering the limited number of prepaid phones t-mobile offers, this is quite the deal. although it is an international version, mostly sold in uk i believe, and the fact that the manual is in another language, i give this phone a high rating. the touch screen is fantastic, the camera is okay, the music playing system is great, the additional stylus pen (i don\\'t really use it)is okay, and the opportunity to expand memory is unbeatable. the downside is that you can\\'t really use the web or set up an e-mail (no wi=fi), and the phone is a bit slow loading your entire music/pictures, and multitasking is nearly impossible. regardless, if you want a stylish phone that performs fundamental functions and you have at&t or t-mobile and want an inexpensive phone, i highly recommend this phone! i bought 2, both runs very slow, batteries last like 10 minutes fully charged, keyboard is delayed, charging port is loose. terrible phone. do not waste your money received the phone exactly as described. it was unlocked, and my t-mobile (us) sim card was recognized right away. the phone came in packaging from a latin american country, but the (brief) instruction manual included is printed in english. when you first turn on the phone it gives you an option to proceed in spanish, portuguese or english. i pressed 3 and my phone was configured for english. the whole process is simple, and i didn\\'t experience any of the negative issues past reviewers have complained about--they seem to have worked out those problems. it\\'s awesome the phone is nice. almost perfect condition. the only thing i miss is the led flash for notifications. but its worth it if you dont mind that. the phone was labeled on amazon as \"new\", but when i went to get it set up, they told me this phone has a contract on it with another carrier and can\\'t be set up till the contract is paid off. not very happy with \"chubbiestech\". the phone guy chuckled when i told him we got it from chubbiestech because he said it happens a lot with their phones. totally pleased with quaity, speed of shipping, and cost. excellent, i like this product meet my expectations! excellent phone, fast! this phone is amazing in terms of performance and battery life. it can run pokémon go with music playing and a dozen background apps open without a hiccup and while consuming less battery than you would expect. as a long time ipod and iphone customer this has exceeded all of my expectations. great phone i highly recommend buying it i received it in 4 days and there\\'s barely any wear or tear. literally brand new not good, because microphone does not work. it is a great cheap phone. it\\'s quite a good phone. was able to meet my needs but the only problem is the battery. it doesn\\'t take me for a day when fully charged perfect cellphone.pro: lovely and comfortable keyboard which is quite rare on the market. adorable looking, acceptable price, long battery life (mine lasts 3 days without heavy usage), powerful os runs smoothly.con: shortage in software (i update it to 10.3.1 and android software runs more beautifully now, but still could be improved). it is the only drawback i noticed so far and i do not mind it that much.i like it. just recieved this phoneand it is scratched terribly and won\\'t take a charge as the charger that came with it causes the phone to say unauthorized cable! second buy from amazon and second huge dissapointment! serious connectivity issues on 3g network after a few days. got as a gift for my dad and he loves it. it\\'s really simple for him to use. only 2 problem we had with it was front facing camera isn\\'t good and doesn\\'t connect to wifi. it\\'s a good looking phone but it would look better if they slimmed it down a little. good phone, but the charger cable isn\\'t compatible with the phone: it\\'s not a apple cable!!! i must buy a new apple cable: 30$.... :(( ok guys please, if you don\\'t know what to do with your money, buy that phone you will have it used for 2 weeks only, cause this is the first crap phone i ever have, i purchased that phone for my birthday, not it stop working, i never dropped that phone and i never put it in the water cause i know it\\'s not a waterproof phone, it was in charge one day when i took it to place a phone call, the phone died i can\\'t do nothing with it, i don\\'t why this seller sold that phone in amazon to steel people money, even though you got refund when you contact amazon and return the defective item, but it\\'s not fair to purchase something and after 2 weeks you start having problem with it, so i encourage everyone to not buy that phone, if you smoke please stay smoking instead of buying that phone cause this one will take you feeling away while using that crap phone...don\\'t tell me that the phone worth the price, or it is a cheap phone, you don\\'t purchase something for the price but you purchase something for you to use in it suppose to be a good quality phone, honestly i regret that i used my debit card on some s*** like that.... \"do not buy it\" i\\'m saying, money is not easy to make, you got to spend a lot hours in order to have $49, so you can\\'t throw it away like that. (a word to salvation) great did what it was supposed to. the tablets stop working just after three days....don\\'t know hw to return it was not unlock didn\\'t get expected product.sim slot is jammed. battery life is bad.took hours to chargekept on restarting after few minutes had it a few days not and so far it is a great phone i purchased this product with prime exclusive pricing with ads in the lock screen, thinking as the description implies the ads would come up like a notification in your lock screen. this was not the case; if your screen was asleep, a full page ad would appear after your lock screen in essence adding an additional step to unlocking the phone. this was much more annoying than originally anticipated and within 3 hours i returned the phone. i am so happy that i was able to get this iphone6s over the summer for a great deal. the phone came well packaged with a charger and had no dents or scratches. i have now used it for 3 months with a full suite of apps (20gb) and have had absolutely no problems (touch id, 3d touch, touchscreen, battery) with heavy daily use. i have been an iphone user for a couple of months now and am very happy with this upgrade. i will update this review if i have any problems with the phone in the future. i do not recommend for use without case and screen protectorafter a month of use:- glass have scratches- plastic edge of the display is damagedandroid 6 do not available on current date (26.02.2016) - current version 5.0.2 it\\'s ok but the constant updates mess with the usage. it\\'s so excelent!!! thanks this phone is the second order from this seller. first one was not an unlocked, i returned it.and also this is not an unlocked phone unfortunately...!it is described as an unlocked. why?? is waste of time for me, i am very anxious...!if you need an unlocked phone look for an other seller. blu studio c minialot of people are getting 5\" to 6\" screen sizebut this 4.7\" screen is more than enough for me.pretty good phonei like that it has no bloatwarei\\'m glad i got it. bought this 6 months ago to replace my iphone after 4 yrs of having an apple phone. i love the 5.5\" screen. this phone has a lot of bloatware and took a lot of time figuring out how to hide icons that could not be deleted. consider another brand with less superfluous icons and maybe for less money. awsome ..love this phone!! came in perfect condition...no broken seal!!..100% satisfied! great product bought it for a friend ,he just charged and placed his sim and that was it ,came with a leather pouch to hold the phone on your waist . it works great. bought this for my husband. he does love it, however it drains his phone too much and too fast. had this phone for almost a year now, and it is by far the best phone i ever had. firstly, i love asphalt 8, airborne, but it says \\'sorry, this app can not work on your device\\'. secondly, the finishing is not good, no quality control. netflix also doesn\\'t seem to work on it either, but every other thing is perfect the audio is very low in calls practically i have to put the phone in my ear to listen, the fonts size are too small and those are not clear.practically lost my money whit this newsunshine an1 android 4.1 dual core 2.0 ordered this as a gift for my daughter\\'s 17th birthday and so far she\\'s in love with it. everything was as described and it even arrived earlier than expected! excellent, very good service software problem wifi and bluetooth is not working and also automatically restarting. amazing quality. i knew what i was receiving because i already owned an iphone 5s. unexpected fast delivery. definitely will buy again ( if i break this one..haha) wine with phone charger damaged the phone works perfectly, fast, accurate. communication programs work perfect, it is the reason for my purchase. the touch keyboard is not very practical because sometimes you touch more than one letter. the camera is not good, the definition is very poor, but i never chose it by the camera, for that i have a much more effective digital camera.. it is not all that. it was everything i expected ! ...i\\'m very impressed with the phone and it came with the 5.0 android update i will wear it as a watch and nothing else. i cant answer calls with it even when connected to bluetooth. i love this device what can i say we all have blu in our home i can\\'t stay off my phablet it is amazing what will blu think of next. no sim card can\\'t read instuctions just a big pain in the butt start to finish , if you could finish. contacted seller several time, to bad you can\\'t understand them any better then the instuctions!!!plus it cost more then the watch to return. would never buy from them again. hi. im bought this phone like a month ago and the phone is not function. i need to know what im dping to fix the problem. thanks a lot and i wait your answer very soon. bye good my son likes his i-phone great product excellent phone i bought for my son and it has dropped to the stairs and the phone still works this is a fantastic phone, especially for the price! coming from a samsung gs4 (which i loved), i was looking for a bigger screen and an escape from bloatware. this phone offered both those needs and gives the quality i\\'ve become used to, with my previous androids. i\\'m very careful with my phones, but feel a little better knowing this one won\\'t cost me $800 to replace if i accidentally damage it. the screen resolution is great, and the 13mp camera takes excellent pictures. i wouldn\\'t hesitate to buy another one if these. the only thing with these is after about 6 months of using, the screen would constantly keep freezing and sometimes blackout horrible!!!! charging port on phone came out and replacement phone would not charge and volume didn\\'t work. the htc incredible 2 was the sorriest piece of junk i ever bought. very unhappy and dissatisfied with my purchase. don\\'t deserve a star!!!! this phone has exceeded my expectations!! i couldn\\'t bought a better phone. good!!! i moved from s2 to s4 and i\\'m really happy with it as i was with the s2. the screen is really big and clear without the phone being as bulky as the note. i wear this on my belt. the new features work fine. the 13mp camera looks amazing as you take pictures. the problem is that you have to take pictures very still. you almost need to use a tripod. if you move just a little, the picture ends up blurry. now the video it takes looks just amazing.the battery doesn\\'t last more than half a day, but i do use it a lot for internet, videos and games so i\\'m used to charging it all night and at work. the processors are really fast and you now have a lot of memory. enough to have multiple big programs open without issue. i used to have some issues installing many apps in my s2 because of small internal memory (not everything could be moved to the sd). i haven\\'t had to worry about that with the s4 yet. i also tested the screen mirroring feature with a nice samsung tv and there was some lag but it was ok. when watching a video, you can just send the video instead of the screen and then there is no lag. i also considered the s5 but this one was $400 and the s5 was more than $600.overall really happy with it. if i learn how to configure the camera so the shutter is faster or it compensates for slight hand movements i will never let go of this phone. seems decent so far. very good very good if not connected to wi-fi, internet does not work at all. camera has a spot from factory. slow. almost every call drops or does not get through. do not waste your money buying from this seller. checked sim, band, software, carrier plan, it just does not work as expected. added photos of camera issue. this is my first ever iphone and i love it so much. thank you nice phone. meets the expectations. good product,fast deliverd,happy this was a store demo phone, you cannot remove the demo software that takes over the phone shortly after turning it on. verizon store actually tried for me but were unsuccesfful and said these phones are not supposed to ever get out to the public. makes me wonder how the company got a hold of them. this s4 very good purchased this item, the phone works fine but i was expecting a frost blue phone but got a tacky sky blue instead....big disappointment excelente. the voice reception was not clear. i have a few minor problems with this phone, however, overall it is great for a replacement until i can upgrade on my contract. love my phone this phone sucks. freezes up a lot and won\\'t load web pages. i regret buying it. phone looks new and has clean imei. not black listed nor has a balance due. no problems with it so far (only been a couple days)would of givin a 5 star review but it says it\\'s brand new and when i went to put my sim card in the phone there was already an att sim installed. found that weird. overall though it seems like a great phone. as someone who just wants a good *small phone*, for making phone calls, i found myself buying this one because it was literally the only small phone i could find (the phone i replaced was a bar phone the size of a chicklets box). every other option available now is either a smart phone or cheap flip-phone garbage.so i chose this phone entirely for its size, not because it\\'s a smart phone (keyboard way too small to type on), and i was very pleasantly surprised at the call quality on the handset and when using bluetooth. i *do* recommend this phone if you just want something small for making calls, but don\\'t get your hopes up.having said that, you get what you pay for:- the pictures provided by the manufacturer are *very* misleading, showing a standard android launcher screen, when in fact this phone has a cheap, custom ux that tries and fails to look like ios.- for no discernible reason, this custom ui doesn\\'t use android standards — for example… - there is no apps tray, and instead all your apps are on your homescreen whether you like it or not - it has a recent apps button, but it\\'s inexplicably used for settings instead - recent apps is instead found only by holding down the home button- the paltry user guide has *no* instructions of any kind about this nonsense custom ui, so you\\'re completely on your own for figuring out stuff like how to reach recent apps, so good luck figuring out how to add widgets or rearrange the home screens (tap and hold on empty spot of launcher)- instead of using the perfectly fine android contacts app, there\\'s a custom contacts app that leaves a lot to be desired- you can\\'t edit or delete contacts stored on your sim card (but you can add new sim contacts) - (you\\'ll have to download \"sim contacts\" by penumbraapps from play store - https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.penumbra.apps.sim_contacts_manager- the maximum volume on the handset isn\\'t loud enough- the maximum volume on the speakerphone *really, really* isn\\'t loud enough- you can\\'t change lock screen background to pic — you\\'re stuck with what they give you- because of screen size, keyboard is nearly impossible to type on - download \"touchpal,\" which is a) the best keyboard for android anyway, b) allows you to resize it (i can type on this one)- status bar shows mobile & wifi signal strength, but *doesn\\'t show bluetooth status* (again, silly custom ui) - however, there is a power control widget you can put on the home screen for that- the battery monitor is wildly inaccurate- if you keep your phone numbers on your sim, the direct dial widget thinks *every* phone number is a mobile phone, and you can\\'t change it- the accelerometer is sketchy — when pulling phone down from face during call, screen comes on only about 1/10th of the time - worse, power button doesn\\'t start up the screen during calls about 60% of the time eitherif anyone else made decent small feature phones anymore, i probably wouldn\\'t have even looked at this one. but if you want a small phone with decent call quality, you\\'re pretty much stuck with this. i needed to get a basic phone and this one meets my expectation. i would recommend this phone as a good basic phone. you can\\'t watch youtube videos on this phone but other than that it\\'s a good phone i have been tracking this phone ever since the nov 2012 release, and i generally had mixed feelings about the types of reviews i read all over the internet. there have been complaints about the weight, about lack of an sd card slot, about it being a windows phone, the list goes on. however, from experiencing this device for myself, i have to say that while it is not the perfect smartphone, it excels in most areas.the phone weighs 185g - considerably more than all of its direct competitors - but it does not feel like an anvil. it more has a solid, almost unbreakable feel (though i\\'m not gonna test that). the samsung galaxy s3 was one of the main competitors at release date, and though it is lighter and thinner than the lumia 920, it also feels quite frail in comparison. i don\\'t find the weight of the phone to be a negative attribute.one other concern i had was how the wp8 environment would treat me, as it is well documented and demonstrated all over that the windows app store is leagues behind google and ios. there are obviously missing popular apps (not least instagram and youtube), but i have been able to find ample replacements so far (metrotube and 6tag) that do the job. if you aren\\'t one to obsess over a name, then you will find these apps more than capable of handling most, if not all of your activities.the phone boasts silky smooth performance, with great visuals and above average speaker output. as far as media storage goes, i\\'m not too concerned about the lack of sd card slot. the device already comes with 32gb built-in. most other flagships at release date topped out at 16gb and not all offered sd storage either.the camera is probably the strongest selling point on any current-gen high end nokia phone, and believe me, these guys have a right to brag. the camera is simply amazing, and there are a bunch of nokia-exclusive imaging apps that make the photo experience so much better.battery life is what i would call average from a smartphone these days and it is probably the biggest negative point on my mind right now. depending upon usage and settings, battery life can vary greatly. if you are one of the users who turns screen brightness down all the way, turns off all services, and keeps the phone running on barebones features, then you can crank 2 days out of the battery easily. if you are like me - a moderate to heavy user who keeps his screen settings on automatic and doesn\\'t bother to turn off things other than location settings, then you will get upwards of 11 hours out of a full charge. i\\'ve seen better, but i\\'ve also seen worse.overall, i\\'m satisfied with the phone. it was either this or a xperia z from sony. the two are totally different experiences, but both have their strong and weak points. the price difference will probably play a role in the decision as well if you are torn between these 2 (though the release of the z1 will surely drop the z\\'s price some more). for anybody questioning why i chose the lumia 920 over the 925, the reasons are simple.the 925 only has 16gb onboard storage as opposed to 32gb on the 920.the 925 does not have a camera that much better than the 920the 925 did not come in red :) perfect condition and works great. this phone was awesome for the one hour that it worked the pictures it took looked great the porcessor was decently fast and ran youtube like a charm. and for those of you who have cricket yes it will automatically pick up your wireless signal and display on the dropdown menu cricket 3g or 4g. but having said what the positive thigns about htis phone was it crashed and got a green screen which then turned red and then would not respond to factory data reset or battery being taken out and placed back in. all in all what looked like a great deal turned outto dissapoint me, remmeber when buying this phone or this brand it is known but not extremely well known so you run the risk of getting a phone that will burn out early. i ordered this phone and it was just great. lasted loooooong time, was resistant, efficient and excellent. all that is expected from nokia and much more. i used this phone for over a month. it works great. great phone. great phone. great phone. it does so much. it is very fast. the battery lasts a lot longer than my last phone and charges up quickly. there are so many things this phone can do. totally awesome great phone, came from samsung devices and want to try htc for a while now, it doesn\\'t let me down, was worried about several reviews on the device about camera and battery quality, don\\'t know if in some patches i received from htc those problems were solved but for me the camera is fine (not as good as samsung but that\\'s not a big issue for me) and battery life really impress me, i use the power saving option turned on always, maybe it has something to do but with medium use the phone have more than 50% at the end of my day, and that\\'s better than samsung in my experience. the phone is a computer, the hardware specs are great and it behave like what it is, a computer grade phone. there are some functionalities from htc that i like a lot, the keyboard is great, really responsive (my advice is that you take the time to make a calibration fro your fingers, that helps a lot), the theme mode for icons and screen is fine, a lot to customize and a lot of great themes available. this is a review after a month of use, let\\'s see how it behave in time. the iphone 4 worked pretty good for 15 days but started acting up when i pushed the home button. it has 60% before i went to bed and at some point through the night it died. very disappointed because this is my business phone. didn\\'t tell me about no charger or anything i ordered 2 of these phones (1 for me and 1 for my hubby). they are both perfect and work well with our carrier! thank you so much!! gave this phone as a present,but only lasted about a month,very cheap and could not load some apps. the phone i brought was good up until it dropped an the screen came out love muy new iphone i had this phone myself. this was for my husband. i found it very easy to use. i like it great phone os is so easy to use and smooth. i don\\'t install the latest developer updates so i have not noticed any bugs. after a few charges the battery easily lasts all day and i only charge it at night. the integration with xbox and other windows 10 devices through cortana is fantastic.not a lot of apps but with windows 10 universal apps taking off there are new apps every week. i don\\'t use a ton of apps so not a big problem for me. continuum is great but i don\\'t use it much as when ever i need a computer i always have my laptop with my any way.the phone is everything i wanted it to be and the best phone i ever had. like with all lumina phones the camera is still one of the best for any phone.only thing that bugs me is that on windows 8.1 phone when you saved shortcuts from your internet explorer out to your desktop it saved it with an image of the web page you were on. now just saves it as a blue icon. i am sure this feature will come back. at the original price of $65 or $70 i probably would not have bought this case but for $20 this thing is well worth it. i can let my wife use the tablet and not be scared that she\\'s going to break it anymore because this thing is extremely strong and rugged.the snap on stand doubles as a screen protector whenever you want to store the tablet on the go and it doubles as the perfect stand to set the tablet on while watching shows in your bed or on the table.it\\'s really the perfect case at $20. good this phone is wonderful will love to have it over and over again unlocked quad-band s29 smart watch phone support camera tf card micro sd card sim card bluetooth wrist smartwatchok, let\\'s start off with the good. for the price point this watch feels and looks pretty high end. the screen is super responsive and the ui is a bit tricky, but after 10-15 minutes i was all good with it. charge time was decent, i went from 50% to full in under an hour. battery life, under normal use, notifications, bluetooth connection, occasional time checking and steps, was ok, full day and it was down to about 45%. so, expect close to 2 days of usage from this watch.the bad: this is android compatible, not android wear. so, there is no way to get google apps on this watch. you\\'re stuck with whatever apps already come with the watch. earpiece is the usb headphones, so you can\\'t use any standard 3.5mm headset with the watch (i have beats and it will not work with it). even though the screen is responsive the apps are not really good and not friendly to use.this watch is an ok experiment, but if you\\'re looking for android wear device this is not it very simple to use..easy to understand...have a little trouble with cell reception in some areas....and the ring tone needs to be louder..but am still pleased with phone i bought that phone in order to be able to use 2 sims abroadthe phone is unlocked for all countries and providersit has good qualities also it is not high range but mid-rangei use it mostly for emails, whatsapp and making calls and it is more than neededfor its price it is a great deal after a month or so it started messing up thinking it has the earphone jack plugged in. now i have to always put it on speaker phone to take a call. i tried everything to fix it and it still shows the monkey with the headphones on. excellent product old matharbord and new cover excellent no problems all were ok phone sucked! had to send it back. where can i purchase a sim card for this phone?!?i prefer a blu sim card but it is a dual carrier so as long as i can purchase a sim card that is compatible that will be fine!!!thank you. the phone was a gift for my sister. she loves it! it never runs slow, updates are simple, great screen and delivers what you expect from a smartphone! i recommend it! if you start adding apps that clog the phone\\'s processor then the brand makes no difference... good afternoon, the team that acquired him in his store received with the problem that the keyboard does not work, which i can not porlo its use, the user manual says nothing about this kind of problem, so i am very dissatisfied with your purchase, i hope your answer and then conduct my evaluation for service pros:- excellent build quality, much better than nokia\\'s and sony ericsson\\'s plastic toys.- really good voice transmission, i\\'m able to talk in noisy environments, and the phone filters the interference.- excellent mp3 quality, much better than previosuly used nokia 5310 and sony ericsson w890.- standard slots and connections: microsd card, micro usb connection, 3.5 headphone jack.cons:- the menus are not great when comparing to both nokia and se. they\\'re not as intuitive as the others. however, they\\'re not slow, and i\\'ve not run into any bug yet.- the camera is mediocre, but this isn\\'t a cameraphone. if you need that, you should buy a moto zn5.overall, i think it\\'s a great purchase for someone who looks for a phone with a great call quality and an excellent music player. the add said it was unlocked and the fact is that i still had to pay extra to someone else to really unlock it and be able to use it was not totally new and has a \"dead\" spot in it. cannot get the back space button to work when texting. ok good phone got it when i want to israel and it was great with long battery life i\\'ve written a detailed review on medium. [...]good- unlocked- no bloatware, minimal extra apps installed- dual sim- sd card slot- screen was nice and bright with decent contrast- performance was on par with expectations for this price range- battery life was very impressive, but i use it mainly without a sim card/data connection so that might help big time.- the phone was comfortable to hold and the back plastic is pretty \"grippy\" which is nice.bad- camera is very bad, do not buy if you plan to take lots of pictures- not a fan of the power button. it\\'s small and i don\\'t like the ascetics or feel of it either.- once i added a bunch of app and widgets the phone really started to slow. i ended up tweaking a bunch of start up apps and using some \"tuning\" apps to get things running faster. at&t versions are always a sh...it. try to change the software asap or try to not buy this versions with it\\'s own \\'software\\' i thought i\\'d take the plunge and join the android craze. i just want my blackberry back. this phone sucks monkey balls.- the battery life sucks. i have shut down everything in the background that should be sucking it dry (gps, bluetooth, etc) and i\\'m still charging it at least twice a day. i work on an ambulance.... i need to have a phone that i know will be charged in order to give patient reports. i can take this phone off the charger before i leave for work and by lunch time it\\'s almost dead.- i have very small hands... i buy little kids gloves.... and even *i* can\\'t text on this thing for crap. i feel like i should send out decoder rings with every text message.- talk about slow. even after i rooted it, it\\'s still insanely slow to respond. i end up in a loop every day because i hit a button then wait 60 seconds for it to respond, hit the button again only to have whatever it is pop up then go away again. makes me want to bang my head against the wall.- my god the fingerprints. i spend all day wiping them off. one more reason i hate touch screens. with a passion.- even rooted it\\'s a train wreck. i thought getting rid of all the bloatware would make a difference, but it doesn\\'t.- this thing looses signal all the time. i got full strength in my house with my blackberry... i barely get 2 bars here.- t-mobile isn\\'t even selling this pos anymore.- it takes it hours to charge fully. sometimes it isn\\'t even charged over night.it does take decent pics and video. the back speaker is surprisingly loud.i\\'m not sure i could hate this phone more all in all. i have ordered a new battery to see if that solves some of my issues. i\\'m not holding my breath and i can\\'t wait to get rid of it. yea its a 5s but still installed ios 10 and works great. i first decided to buy the phone because it was relatively within my budget and i\\'ve never really been one for fancy phones. a couple weeks after i received it, the phone started acting funny. when i changed to a different screen, i\\'d notice that the screen i was on before would remain in the background forever, i kid you not! videos are not really clear, but sound quality is really good(louder than my laptop!) overall, if you dont have another choice, it\\'ll do. but i don\\'t see it as a good quality long-term cellphone. bought this phone a few months ago. it was puschase as new sent it to my son in the caribbean at first everthing worked fine after only two weeks a couple of the buttons stop working. he took it to a blackberry store only only to be told its a refurbish product. now my problem is with amazon if u guys are going to have companies sell stuff through you then you should be held responsible for all the defective products being sold through you amazon .i have been a loyal customer to amazon and have bought other products that i am happy with but not this time around.amazon please pay attention to these reviews great price, extremely fast shipping works as advertized! bad buy,. not good cool i bought this phone as a replacement for a stolen iphone and i couldn\\'t be happier. 3g, gps, wi-fi, music, email, etc. all for 320 dolars. it\\'s very stylish as well when compared to a blackberry or other smartphones with full qwerty. i was disappointed i thought the came with a charger did not get one the battery charging time is very short. the outgoing and incoming calls do not connect sometimes i really love my phone it\\'s perfect for me very nice phone! performs extremely well for the price! i\\'m in love. all good 1.usb charging is faulty and loose2.keypad sometimes freezes when i am typing3.power saver pops up even when battery is full when i have set it at 10%for a new phone which is only less than 4 weeks old to have problems at a very early stage am wondering what willhappen in the next few months. might end up buying another phone from the way i see it soon after i bought this phone i noticed i wasn\\'t getting 4g lte as promised all i was getting was h+ or 3g. i did a little digging and found this model was for if you live in europe and the only way to get it here and have the 4g lte work in where ever you live:samsung sm-g900f for europesamsung sm-g900i for asiasamsung sm-g900k/g900l/g900s for koreasamsung sm-g900m for vodafonesamsung sm-g900a for at&tsamsung sm-g900t for t-mobilesamsung sm-g900w8 for canada excellent this phone is awesome 😬. thank you good i bought this cell as a little birthday gift for my friend- he likes it! and it is not expensive, right? i purchased this item for my son who had this same blackberry he dropped his in water so of course stop working. he is very happy with the phone so far it arrived quickly and even came with a case. we are very satisfied with this amazon purchase. excellent phone. it\\'s really light, very smooth and fast. good screen and camera. it\\'s not the best phone on the market that is sure, but it\\'s the best price-performance comparison phone good so far this is a nice phone for the money. the camera makes it though. even if i didn\\'t use it as a phone i\\'d still use it as a camera / wifi web browser. it\\'s not the best at web browsing but functional. i\\'m using my att gophone account with a new sim card. i still had an old flip phone when att made me get something more up to date so i can\\'t compare. all in all though it\\'s been pretty good. i like the fm radio and weather keeping track where i am. the bluetooth connected easy to my gps for hands on driving. great phone for this price. excellent phone. a little complicated to configure. work fine overseas in both gsm and lte. excellent phone,i had to buy a phone with a great camera for my work, the camera is not only excellent but the phone is very easy to navigate. i use tmobile, and the service is very good. the only issue is texting images and media which is resolved by adapting the settings to the tmobile apn, just had to search on the internet to get those codes, the only reason i was not going to give the phone 5 stars is that i have yet to figure out how to email a high res photo from the phone.i downloaded phriz b but it is still not working,fortunately some of my clients can accept a lower resolution, but if i could figure this issue out, this phone would be perfect, i had a samsung galaxy prior to this, and this so much better. just perfect! i love... too bad it didn\\'t come with 1gb ram thou... very good phone delivered as promised works great good job! i love it! like new and work great also out of the usa! i would buy this phone again and again...... makes weird sounds if you accidentally bump it almost sounds like something is breaking but nothing has broke yet i really like my new phone! it is taking me awhile to familiarize myself with it, but i have not had any major problems. the battery does seem to run down very quickly, but other than that...no problems! for a great phone, no more to say, this cell phone got everything you need, robust desing, lot of app\\'s. this phone is great and loud! my previous phone was a cubot and i founds it very quiet. i bought this phone for 2 reasons, 1 it was small and 2 it was a \"music\" phone. i was happy with the width as i find 5\" phones to wide for me to use. the sound was a wonderful surprise. if you are looking to play music on a phone this is a great choice. i do wish there was a nice silicone cover for the back tho. i like everything about the phone hola, disculpen la demora, si recibi mi telefono celular curve 8520, en buenas condiciones, es facil, rapido y comodo comprar por este medio; nunca antes lo habia hecho realmente, los felicito por ser tan responsables, gracias.. so much for my 90 day warranty. had my phone for less than 60days and now doesn\\'t work. get what you pay for. amazon didn\\'t help at all. buyer beware i love this cell phone works very good whit movistar in venezuela i bought the storm2 through amazon, after reading some of the earlier reviews i was a bit skeptical of how the purchase would go but i decided to bite the bullet. the shipment came in earlier than i anticipated and the phone came in original package. the phone had some minor scratches on the back but it is in great condition. i initially had some problems using the phone outside of the us but the phone seems to have steadied a bit. i would recommend using this seller to anyone. excellent the phone is falsely advertised as a \"8 gb internal memory\", whereas it only has 1.5 gb internal memory. not enough internal memory, you would struggle with apps. from samsung site you can check that rom is 8gb. excelente i have been using this p9+ vie-l29 since i received it about 4 weeks ago. the camera is super! if you like to take pictures, you won\\'t be disappointed with the image quality.the phone is easy to set up which only took me few minutes. the smart phone started working the way it should be after plugging in a new sim card from at&t. however i realized that the 4g label never appears next to the signals bars on the top line of the display. it stays at 3g!!! despite the good amount of effort from mega mobile in helping me to try out various apn settings in addition to what i could find in the internet for at&t networks, the p9+ that i got just does not run in 4g. i\\'ve made sure that data is enabled on the phone and wifi is turned off but it just stays at 3g. i put another phone, huawei p8 lite, side by side with the p8+, the much cheaper p8 lite performs in 4g but not the p9+. i live in silicon valley, 4g coverage is very good, so i am very disappointed that my p9+\\'s 4g is not working. at&t checked on my sim card, said it is a 4g sim card. now i am pretty much stuck. if any readers/users out there knowing what i can do, please post your suggestions. thanks!update (10-04-2016): added 3 more stars.continuing with my investigation on the 4g failure, i managed to borrow a at&t nano sim card that is proven functioning with 4g. i plugged it into my p9+, the phone immediately operated in 4g! so, it means at&t issued me a faulty sim card but insisted that it was all good.i took my 4-wk old p9+ to another at&t store and asked for another sim for my 4g phone. in short, i have the 4g problem finally resolved but during the course of action, i have learned that when at&t realized that the phone is not from the us, they would choose to disable 4g/lte or, not to program the 4g/lte functionality into the sim card despite the phone has the capability and 4g/lte is being subscribed. sad! great product good one excelente the volume did not go as high as my old same model phone did.. not good, arrived with broken crystal and not working at all unable to get any use out of it, wasted money no comment.... i arrive on time, present technical failures i\\'m shocked! after 7 days of using the phone, he fell from a small chair and the glass breaks into small pieces. replacing of the glass is a half of the phone price. how can you do such a thing unreliable? phone defective damaged power button and battery back good all my expectations decent cell phone, cannot beat the price. very good phone wrong product sent. what i ordered did not come. the correct product should be c6 not c6-01. nice phone but not what i wanted.:( just like it! product is 5/5 but im a little bit concerned because the seal was broken and was replaced with a fake seal. after careful examination i have found out that original seal was underneath the fake one. i\\'m in the u.s. and i had to go on a singaporean samsung website to register my product. shouldn\\'t internationals versions be able to register from any where? so i do not know what to do if my product malfunctions. so buyer be aware. i upgraded to the s5 from the note, and i\\'m very happy with it. battery duration is way better than the note\\'s, it\\'s fast, excellent screen size and doesn\\'t feel so bulgy in the pocket.special kudos for the possibility of washing the device in the sink (water proof), of drawing and writing on it using a regular, graphite pencil, and for the slow motion video (240 frames per second).for my fellow citizens, it works perfectly with 4g in brazil. best telephone i have ever used. excelente purchase, the phone is like new 👍 i had an issue where my charging port had entirely stopped working, making it impossible to charge this phone. i sent my phone back to blu, who after almost 3 weeks sent me a brand new one.----as a iphone user who looked at several samsung phones, i was initially concerned about buying a phone that only cost $350. this thing came in a beautiful box and has a premium feel to it. it doesn\\'t feel cheap at all.blu gives you everything with this phone: a quick charger, usb cable, two cases, nfc stickers and a screen protector.this phone has a notable screen- it is beautiful. the camera is decent and the speakers are nice and loud. you get used to the crazy size very quickly too.this phone has found a few scratches, but with no case or screen protector, i am not surprised.there are a few software quirks: android pay works now, but the notification led seems to not be controllable by any third party app, and the settings menu is quite heavily modified by blu. that being said, as i write this, developers are working on a custom rom for this phone.overall, an awesome device at an irresistible price. phone came in perfect condition and has no problems at all!!! it\\'s the worst i\\'ve been able to buy, is a very expensive phone and a lie that is waterproof, it accidentally submerged in a wading pool for a period less than one minute and equipment damage. no useless and i have no such contact seller for the warranty. this phone defiantly meets and exceeds all expectations and standards that are listed in the description.. i love it. the color is very vibrant and the camera/overall quality of everything is outstanding. i use it through straighttalk but the dual sim option and unlocked carriers just tops it off. nice seller. on time. just as expected. recommenden can\\'t download any pictures or upload anything!!! but it\\'s compatible with my service. very good product excellent very good phone the only thing i do not understand is that i get the tel no original and sealed box yay! glad i bought three of these tried and tested s5 phones - at least my house is not at risk of burning down.all brand new - worked great - and charge quickly.. the last steve jobs design. i love this format. it\\'s still a phone. i don\\'t want a tablet on my ear. coming from a 5s, don\\'t see much diffrence. love this phone. well worth what i payed for it!! steer clear of blu, go with this phone for $60 it works well with all the standard features you need from a droid. i did not realize the phone was a verizon phone have to return i have att carrier i am notorious for dropping my phone. ever since i got this otterbox, i\\'ve lost the need to worry if i broke the screen or if i got water in the plug holes of my phone. and the clip on case that came with it made it easy to carry my big iphone 5s. i am glad i got it works great but can not download the app to use my messages on watch excelente. got some ugly dirts on the back and could not mop off. generally it\\'s ok with a case i love this phone. it\\'s super fast very light. i love the slim built of the phone. i would recommend this product excelent phone, i love it i will like to understand how to do a warranty refund fast delivery. and so far works like a brand new phone. it came in perfect condition. item arrived fast and complete. item matched description very well. thank you. great i am very pleased with the products as shown in the pictures i recommend excellent phone at low price this phone was sold as new worked for 3 mnths then stopped took it to the nearest apple store which was 3 hrs away for them to tell me it was a \"frankinstien\" meaning there were some apple parts an some that were not now nobody will help 300$ just gone i really like the iphone 5s, i can reach everything on the screen with my thumb. i am wondering about the future of apple since the death of steve jobs though. they are involved with dr dre now and i heard they are going to make bigger phones, something steve jobs was against. guess we will see. gizmo trader took great care of me and the phone was described to a t down to a scratch on the corner......very good company and even better products i ordered this phone and it shows on the description that it is gsm unlocked. i activated sim with ultra mobile , its started working but data plan is not working , i called customer service they said that phone seems not be fully unlocked , please let me know if any suggestion. its a really cool mobile i love this phone - i am a big apple fan but need a \\'real\\' keyboard. i probably would have bought an iphone if i could get it with a keyboard. this phone is the perfect compromise - blends the best features of the blackberry with the iphone, and available unlocked to boot.3g works great, voice quality is excellent, battery life is fantastic. i also love the form factor - the keyboard is nicely laid-out and well-sized, screen is very sharp, and the build quality is terrific. this phone is absolutely gorgeous, and extremely well-built.also, nokia\\'s free mac syncing software does a great job of syncing with both itunes and iphoto for music, video and pictures. has a nice pc suite as well (i sync it with my windows laptop at work)only downside is the camera - it\\'s ok, but despite the 3.2 mp pictures look grainy and the colors aren\\'t quite right. rumor has it a firmware upgrade will fix that but haven\\'t heard for sure yet.if you\\'re considering the blackberry bold or iphone you should at least check this phone out as an alternative - for me it\\'s the perfect blend of the best features of both. i love this phone. i had it a few days and it works fine. the speed is good, the apps work fine. i haven\\'t worked all the functions yet but the only downfall that i have experience is the battery. when the phone is fully charged and i text a few people load in my contacts, surf the internet for 30 minutes or so, the battery goes low quickly. the cellphone does not connect to the lte-4g network. it only works with 3g. the phone works well, but the glass on the front breaks very easily. after using an older smartphone for the past 4 years with no issues, it was quite surprising (and disappointing) to pull this one out of my pocket just a few days after i started using it and find that the front of the screen had a crack all the way through it. the phone still works, but the large crack across the screen makes me sad every time i see it. works just fine. love the larger numbers. a++ i throught the item was made bettrer then it look\\'s, the screen could be a little bigger then it is now. but i like the functions and the style the item. i ordered this since it is mentioned unlocked. i ordered this to use outside us. unfortunately 3g is not supported there so i\\'m stuck with this phone only having edge. my recommendation is, if anyone intention to use this outside us please check that country 3g bands and make sure it is matching with the one mentioned in this phone. (4g hspa+ up to 21mbps 850/1700/1900) so i\\'ve no use this phone now and can\\'t be returned also. my brother in law love it great phone. great camera. 💯👍🏽 soy de venezuela el producto vino malo, lo mandee a reparar aqui y me dijeron que ya tenia varias reparaciones echas, y aqui los catalogaban como nuevo!! mal vendedor mal producto i\\'ve had it for about a month. i had no problems activating it with verizon and it works like a new phone! i\\'m not an iphone lover, but my daughter love it.so that\\'s fine with me. very good unbelievable!!! received phone and the previous owner never released it - sprint can\\'t set it up for us and keeps getting an error message because of it. came in perfect condition with everything included 4,000 mah battery, 5.5 inch screen, android lollipop straight out of the box! what\\'s there not to like about this product? ..... i used the blu studio energy before this device i have to be honest to say this device is horrible in comparison to its predecessor....... animations are more choppy...... everyday tasks are not as smooth the only thing that makes this phone worth it is the battery, i was actually impressed by the battery. when i first received my phone i charged to 100% and the first time i used it the device lasted about 2.5 days with heavy usage (screen all the way bright, games, shopping, youtube , netflix etc.) the battery is a definitely something to brag about but this phone in general was just not for me. hopefully in the future blu can increase the price a little bit more for a little better performance and screen quality obviously it\\'s not a new phone. there are scratches on the screen. after 1 day, the battery still can not be 100% charged. i returned the phone. i\\'m very happy with this unlocked galaxy s7. i like the size, excellent camera, good battery life. would not go for the edge model -- too large and expensive. came with a uk type plug for the charger, but also an adapter for us outlets. better if it were european/us, but it\\'s unlocked and great for travelers who carry a sim for the countries they visit/live in. way better if you have a samsung, iphone doesn\\'t work to great all you can do is call on it. also my camera was crooked. excelente.. very simple, very basic. slow running with games. battery: it charges slow (very slow), and discharges fast (really fast). the electrical is defective when i only using only two weeks. good work well and doe exactly what i was looking for. bought this for my dad on father\\'s day. he loved it and my mom did too! in fact she liked it so much she bought her own i was not impressed! bought this phone and brought it to my phone store (tmobile)...didn\\'t work with sim card! a waste of time and money. wrote review with phone it\\'s cool:) no sim card better then i expected!!! :-) i bought this phone in june as my contract with my carrier was finished end of july and i\\'d be taking my business to an alternative carrier that allowed phones to be brought in independently.i literally activated and started using this phone 7/25/16. it is now 7/28/16 and here\\'s what i\\'ve discovered.1. the battery life is s***. from leaving my house at 10pm with 100% battery life, to checking my phone at 11:15pm, i was down to 85%. i hadn\\'t placed any calls, texts or used internet in an hour and fifteen minutes, but the life was down.2. it takes three to six tries to get a page to open in the mini o (internet). this is neither efficient or convenient to my usage.3. there\\'s only 4gb of memory so i purchased a mini sd card of 32gb which i installed, but the phone kept interrupting me to let me know my internal memory was low, like every 30 seconds i had anything open. it\\'s like, yes i got it the first time.4. after shutting off my phone and plugging it in to charge, it no longer turns on. i checked the battery and even tried a different charger. no dice.this thing is basically a pretty paperweight at $73. it did not work well from the begining and the response from the seller is useless.dear siri had written to you earlier from india over 3 months ago stating the problems i am having. strangely you have not addressed my questions, the most important being whether what was sold to me was a new product as advertised. instead of addressing questions clearly raised, you have chosen to side track and not respond to questions asked. this kind off attitude will certainly reflect very badly on a trusted site such as amazon. as stated earlier this phone did not work properly from the begining. also one expect a minimum 1 year or atlest 6 month warranty on new products purchased from a trusted site like amazon.to state \"the return period for this device has expired\" without reason/explaining the return policy in the first place is very un-proffesional to say the least. most dis-satisfied with the response received. great phone. great phone, great shipping great phone, a lot better than the iphone 4. very good phone i got this few days before christmas and it came it right in time. the phone is nice and hardly any scratch or ding. my daughter loves it and she enjoy using it. so far everything lo0ks go0d, will update if there\\'s any concern on the phone, hopefully not. simple phone with excellent battery life and perfect size... excellent 3rd posh phone. overall excellent performance. data connection is only 3g despite its claims and display of 4g. battery life is not the best but will get you through the day for heavy users. this phone is an excellent choice, price for performance. i have had zero problems with the phone itself. i love apple products and so far it stands up to any other i have had. the phone arrived sooner than expected, so as for the iphone 6 it is a great device. i love my new phone. i get so many compliments and it looks and works great stopped working after 3 days had to send it back. could not even get it to turn on. i was so mad. not a smartphone, yet pretty smartafter my nokia e51 came to an end, i started looking for a replacement that would best suite my needs. taught by previous experiences, my aim was a larger screen unlocked phone equipped with gps device, intuitive user interface, decent sync, email and tethering capabilities, w-lan and a modern media player.after days of research, my choice came down to two models: nokia n86 and sony ericsson w995a. both feature excellent characteristics, and seem to perfectly meet my needs. at the end, the design weighted in favor of the se.the phone comes in three flavors: red, progressive black and brushed metal. i bought mine from amazon, and they only had the progressive black model. note that my model\\'s name is w995a, which means that it supports frequencies across americas, but rest reassured, it works in europe and asia as well on all networks, gsm and 3g.when you take it out of the box, it smells good, feels new and geeky :) once you get to play with it, it feels solid in hand, and the sliding mechanism is excellent. the phone comes with an usb cable, wall charger, headphones, battery, printed and electronic documentation, and a generous 8gb memory card. note that some operators in certain countries give you a set of plug-in stereo speakers, but those don\\'t come standard.it\\'s a slide form factor quad-band phone with 2.6\" display, 8.1 mp camera, kickstand, secondary video call camera, sony walkman with dedicated buttons, 3.5mm audio jack (thank you, sony ericsson, it was about the time) w-lan, and loads of other features.at first, i found its buttons rather uncomfortable, for they are fairly flat and wide, and you need to operate them with you fingernails. the upper command buttons feel odd too, especially answer and hangup ones, for they are located at the very edge of the device. but it did not take me long to accommodate.the display is fairly large, showing crisp and clear images, and allowing various sizes of text to be displayed correctly. its resolution of 320x240 pixels isn\\'t exactly the top of the class, neither is the color range of mere 256k. however, i ran a test with a .jpg image taken with my nikon camera on sony ericsson w995 and nokia e51, featuring 16m colors. surprisingly enough, comparing side-by-side the two models, the w995 display proved to have more vibrant colors, and the overall impression of the image was by far better nokia\\'s one.the phone comes with its own default animated and beautiful theme that goes great with its design. if you prefer the classic sony ericsson looks, you can switch back at any time, though the selection of themes that comes pre-installed is poor.experience of browsing through menus, writing messages and making calls is ok, even though the interface sometimes lacks responsiveness due to animated themes and quantity of contents.furthermore, w995 comes with tons of apps and features you easily get used to and never want to leave behind. for example, pedometer, accelerometer, shake control, location service, and many great solutions that exploit this hardware make this device a very versatile must-have multi purpose pocket device you always want to carry around. less known goodies of this products are the camera flash that can be used either as torch or as sos signaling device, and the usb battery charging capability. the last one is particularly useful when you say tether it with a computer to go online. this normally drains your battery very quickly, but in the case of w-series, your battery is being recharged instead of consumed. and when you press the +/- volume button in standby mode, it displays a clock with some basic information across the entire screen. additionally, the phone comes filled with cool games that are great for killing time on airports :) and a coupon for a free download of 100 sony production songs.what i particularly liked about this phone is the ease of tethering with any major os platforms out there. i\\'ve tested it on a mac (snow leopard 10.6) and windows xp professional, and it worked like a charm. with w995, using your phone as a gsm or 3g modem is no longer a nightmare. the functionality is built right in, and when you connect it to any computer via an usb cable, you get prompted to choose amongst the fallowing: use your phone as modem, mass storage, file transfer, sync or pc suite.viewing / listening to media content is an amazing experience. the interface is easy and intuitive thanks to dedicated buttons, and the sound quality is unprecedented. however, getting your contents to your phone is another pair of shoes.while the pc suite is an excellent peace of work, the software for mac looks and feels poor. it all seems like sugar and cream for you pc guys out there, but what about us, the mac users? well, it\\'s not that we\\'re not taken into consideration, far from that. however, serious improvements are yet to be made issuing mac-sony ericsson friendship. what you get on the sony ericsson web site is an isync plugin (available only recently), allowing you to sync your contacts, tasks, and calendars between w995 and your mac. and mediasync, which is, or should be, the equivalent of mediago. the truth is, it allows you to transfer music and podcasts, but not the videos. kind of sad. the good side is that it works well with itunes library, and manages your music and podcasts flawlessly. yet transferring videos between a mac and your w995 still remains an issue. there are ways around, but they don\\'t always work.on the isync level, things are not shining either. with the older version of isync plugin, the synchronizing process was fairly time consuming since it was not incremental. that means that every time you want to synchronize your contacts, tasks and calendars, it completely replaces the entire content. this was soon fixed by an updated plugin, so now it takes far less time. furthermore, it crippled my address book since the two databases are still far from compatible.however, this all shows that sony ericsson is still pioneering in the mac compatibility field, and hopefully these issues will be addressed in the upcoming versions of firmware. what i do like about the sony ericsson bluetooth syncing is that you can enable it to always accept demands from known devices. that way you no longer have to frenetically look for your device (pocket? desk? handbag? quick!), each time isync starts. just make sure it\\'s within the bluetooth range, and you\\'re in sync, with no annoying dialogues around.another annoying thing about this product is the lack of support for certain character formats. so when you receive an email written in say croatian keyboard layout, instead of the actual content, it displays a \"unknown character set\" message. so it\\'s clear to see that w995 is still pretty much an unfinished product, from the firmware developing standpoint.and now to camera! i had no special demands on my phone\\'s camera, so i completely forgot about it. but when i got to play with it, i found that it\\'s not bad at all. in fact, it\\'s a 8,1mp camera with autofocus, flash, face and smile recognition, and loads of other features from the k-series! and the picture quality is awesome! holy cow! the down side is that the picture quality suffers dramatically in low light conditions: the colors fade or go crazy, contours mix up, and a huge amount of noise takes away all the pleasure. so you can either try to save it in an image editing software or just be honest and conclude that the pic sucks. up to you :)so the bottom line is: shot on sun, and keep the good impression. another interesting thing about the camera is a dedicated shutter button. very nice feature. however, it can also be a problem at times. you see, when you want to take a picture, first you need to press the shutter button halfway down, to allow the autofocus to find objects you presumably want to sharpen up. the process takes up to 5 seconds, after which you get this annoying beep, meaning: now you can press the button all the way down. yeah, right. your object is by than far away from the frame, the kids are no longer smiling, and the dog just knocked off chasing his tale. this can be particularly annoying when asking someone to take a picture of you.last but not the least: the build quality. though the phone is solid and feels expensive, my recommendation is to pay attention to scratches and bruises. the chassis is extremely sensitive to scratches, and i recommend buying a screen cover and a some kind of protective case right away. the sony ericsson logo is subject to damage as well as the \"w995\" sign, since both are no other but stickers and tend to peel off with the time.all in all, an excellent phone, but the competition in its price range is stiff. some software issues remain loose ends, but they\\'ll probably get ironed up.the good:-features (big)-camera (despite all the odds)-3.5 audio jack-unprecedented media experience-usb charged battery-intuitive interface-dlna (haven\\'t tested it though)-sliding mechanism-attention to detailsthe bad-poor mac compatibility-poor build quality of the chassis-lack of character support for many languages in default email app-kickstand feels clumsy-wlan doesn\\'t work in some hotspots-lack of search storage capability-browsing through address book feels like the year 2000-other small imperfections in firmware good phone for the value. you cannot beat the price for unlocked phone. i am using this phone once i travel overseas. the quality and speed of the phone is good. it works perfectly and delivery was fast. love the phone received it on may 16th and now it will not charge unless the charging cord is rigged in some kind of way and i know it\\'s the charging port bc i have tried 7 different charging cords and 4 different charger wall plugs. and since friday has been shutting itself off and on several times throughout the day. so aggravating i bought this phone 2 months after having bought blu life one for the first time and the screen shattered completely so i\\'ve bought 2 phones in the past 6 months. excellent phone and it works great with 3g movistar in venezuela, initially thought that the phone came locked for use only in europe but putting on my sim card worked perfectly movistar received this the last week of july \\'16. the phone arrived right before our 2 week vacation so i took it for a spin using the gps. i had a little better luck with mapquest then with google maps, but in both cases i\\'ve had issues with the gps staying active. if i pre-program it prior to leaving and don\\'t press start right away, it doesn\\'t seem like it is working when i press start and start driving. i\\'ve had to restart the phone several times to get it to activate.i love the fact that the radio works. wifi, which gets used almost daily, has been awesome. google voice and youtube work as they should.still getting used to the size. would have preferred a 4\" with lollipop. hard to fit in the pocket.. also still getting used to talking on the phone.the battery, which is 3000 mah, seems to get eaten through pretty fast when the screen is on. other than that, no issues. excellent item i love it bought this for my mom and she loves it. she has no complaints so a good buy overall phone sold as new was clearly used. it came shrinkwrapped in branded packaging, however, the phone lacked protective coverings as seen clearly in any in boxing video. upon turning the phone on there was noticable light bleed down the left hand side of the screen as it was delaminating or not seated properly. there were also dead pixels and a very noticeable light spiderwebbing underneath the glass, kind of as if it had been dropped and the lcd was damaged. upon the first boot up, i pressed the square navigation key and was met with several programs i did not launch. one of these was the camera app which clearly showed the face of another person in there room. this phone was clearly used and damaged by the previous owner. the deception of re shrinkwrapping the box and representing it as new is not only unappreciated by a buyer spending nearly $300 on an item, but very lazy also, as it\\'s condition was not passable in the slightest. wow super purchase...all my six phones are unlocked and truly gsm unlocked.great thanks guys. bought this for my nephew as a \"mini tablet\" to use on airplane mode so he could watch youtube and play his games. runs minecraft pe and goat simulator without lag. it came with a screen protector and a silicone case not too shabby. amazing phone!! great camera and so fast. i never have issues with it!! i absolutely love this phone! i use this as a media device while working out, so i don\\'t know how it functions as an actual phone. i think if i were using it as a phone... actually there\\'s no way i\\'d use this for a phone. i\\'d go crazy. but then i have a giant phablet and love it for playing games and reading ebooks. but the things that make it great for that make it horrible for working out, which is why i went looking for something small and inexpensive to use at the gym.this phone fits the bill fantastically! i would have gone 4.5 stars if that was an option. the only real downside is the keyboard. like the other reviews said, it is absolutely ridiculous. i didn\\'t think it could be as bad as they said, but they\\'re not exaggerating; it\\'s nearly impossible to use, even with a stylus. i don\\'t have large fingers and generally don\\'t have problems with keyboards. getting signed into android and the few apps i wanted to use it for took far too long and made me want to throw the darn thing across the room. i downloaded the free trial of swype and that helped a little, but there\\'s really only so much you can do when you\\'re working with a screen that small.but now that i\\'m signed in and set up, it\\'s great! i\\'ve been using it for a week or so now, and it\\'s everything i\\'d hoped it could be! it\\'s small and relatively flat, and it fits in the pocket of my running shorts designed for keys. the apps i needed work just fine, as does the wifi and the bluetooth for my headphones. the lack of app drawer was odd but since i don\\'t use it for much other than a few apps, i just put the ones i need on the home screen and don\\'t really have to mess with the others. things are kinda slow to open, but that\\'s understandable because, again, i\\'m comparing to a much more powerful phone. and once they open, they work just fine.if you\\'re looking for a media device with wifi and bluetooth that\\'s small enough to fit in those tiny little key pockets built into running shorts, this is perfect! the team came with a ripping the home button , the return was done . the phone had warranty so i was able to replace it several times with apple, however the fact that i replaced it so much was annoying.i used this phone with h20 but you don\\'t get pic messages only with imessage, i used page plus the coverage was decent in my area. i used it with verizon and overall the prepaid verizon coverage is decent. however the fact that i had to replace the phone through apple several times was annoying but i appreciated having the ability to do so with the 1 year warranty good product a+++++++++ i like the dimensions of this cell, but the very low capacity of his sistem make i dislike it. canot install apps, or games or anything else cause it don\\'t have enough space to store this things, so i need to use it on basics functions and apps.... bought this phone for my mom. she didn\\'t need a sophisticated, high-tech phone. this was simple, a good size for her, compatible with t-mobile high speed data, and you can download your regular apps from the playstore. only downside is poor battery life. excelente producto love love love it. i just love my phone. it does what it says. excellent battery life. while everyone else is scrambling to plug their phones in, im letting them borrow my charger cause i just don\\'t usually need it.lol excelente product and excelent supplier. timely delivery. product according to the specifications. excelent quality-price relation, easy to use. wifi very useful excelent camera. i strongly recommend it. the phone was not working at all. i had to return it and now i need to find me a good samsung galaxy. be careful when you order. still going strong! bought it for my wife. she dropped it in the toilet and we cleaned it up with alcohol and sticking it in rice. the dual sim is a cool feature but you have to set up everything each time. we use it for the bvi between the usvi and the vpn has to be put in now and then looks new, no scratches are all, i recommend this phone is really good. i was looking for an upgrade from a previous android phone. am glad i purchased this one. the camera\\'s are amazing\\' i was pleasantly surprised at how clean the pics are. the only downside is that the headphone is at the bottom but i could live with it. i would recommend this phone. nb this is the 2015 version. it\\'s battery life is great. it\\'s very responsive to touch. the only issue is that sometimes the screen goes black and you have to press the top button several times to get the screen to re-illuminate. i bought this device for my 16 year old nephew, so far no complains everything works as described, it was shipped in a timing matter and the packaging was secured es perfecto. i want to thank amazon and the people that sells things on amazon. when my co-worker told me i can find a lot of good stuff on amazon.com for cheap i was skeptical because i really don\\'t like to shop on line and especially i don\\'t like using my debit card online plus i thought i was going to be disappointed. so as soon as i got home i went on amazon.com and saw the iphone that my son wanted and i didn\\'t have to spend that much for it. he needs it for school and his birthday is coming up so he\\'s happy and i\\'m happy...thanks again amazon!! taliah. excelente ok this phone is absoulutly perfect and everything i hoped it would be for my boyfriend he cant wait to use it!!! shipping was a little late but that wasnt there fault 😊😊😊😊😊 amazing phone id deffinitly recomend this!! the unlocked iphone works great internationally. i purchase it for a 2-yr assignment in brazil and have to say it worked well, never had an issue. good backup phone bought this for my parents who were reluctant to try a smartphone when their razr stopped working on their provider. didn\\'t work. gave 3 stars because the seller tried to make it right but the second didn\\'t work either. oh well, i tried. still working my daughter was very pleased with it. a truly unlocked phone. i charged it and it was ready to go. it is no iphone, but for those who would like to be introduced to the blackberry user interface, this is your phone. i placed two orders one for lg cu920 and lgcu720 and paid for new phones but when delivered were refurbished thing that indicate as refurbished because i chat with an lg rep and based upon my info on these products about their functionality he told me they are refurbished. instruction books were not original instead photocopied and top of that was black and white print. cannot transfer files from a webpage. ringtone so low hardly can be heard in an open area due to which i missed several calls. therefore clearly to mention that in these product i was totally mislead, charged money for new product but delivered refurbished ones. so please customers when ordering any unlock cell phone make sure they are delivered new, if for any reason you are hinted that it is refurbished or used one please return it immediately without hasel. i received the phone in good condition i love the phone have to get use to it. it seems like good phone with dual sim color is neon pink love it. recommendee for y\\'all androids user the phone is everything i expected and more its look is almost brand new everything is working no complain... its an awesome phone .... value is greater than the price... works well for a disposable cheep phone. somewhat difficult to use as menu structure not orginized well. audio volume and quality poor. yes this iphone is amazing and i absolutely love it it\\'s frozen on me once but all i had to do was restart it over all great phone and long lasting battery this is a great product and works as expected. i am impressed at how easy it was to switch over to my active verizion account. thank you for backing your product. first things first, this is not a bad phone by any means. i like the design where the buttons are all on the back of the smartphone, its very unique. the phone is fast and snappy, i had no big problems with it when it came in. the box was a little torn up when it came in, but that is not a big problem to me. the battery life on the phones has not perform so well although it has a 3000mah battery. i think overtime it will get better. one bad thing about this phone is the screen quality. i don\\'t know if my phone is defected or not, but it seems that every time that i would press hard on the screen, there appear to be pressure creating a blurry white circle on the screen. it\\'s not really a big problem since i don\\'t press phone screens hard, usually. but, it does get annoying when you are playing games and pressing down hard at the screen which creates that blurry white circle. everything else about this phone is flawless. one more thing, the lg ui sucks, but i downloaded nova launcher which is a million times better. bien i bought three unlocked smartphones (on amazon) to use and evaluate: samsung galaxy 4, nokia 920, and blackberry 9930. after six months experience, here are my thoughts.i have relied heavily on my pc and a dumb cell phone for more than 20 years, but i finally decided to get a smartphone.as a user i like the samsung least in terms of its user interface and focus on advertising stuff. the nokia 920 has a brilliant screen and the best graphics for games and movies. but as a communicator, the bb 9930 is the best!to quote a line from the movie star wars regarding the millennium falcon, \"it\\'s got it where it counts\". if your focus for a phone is (1) phone calls, (2), sms, and (3) email, then blackberry 9930 (also 9900) is the best. virtually no advertising fluff is imposed on the user.as i said, i wanted a phone, first and foremost. however, you might be interested to know that it is also a brilliant mp3 player.here is some other information which i hope some readers find helpful.p. s. my service provider is telna, which i have used for years. their pay-as-you-go, no-subscription-contract (for voice, sms, and data) is brilliantly cost-effective! their gsm sim card interfaces perfectly in the blackberry 9900/9930.p. p. s. i read the reviews of some users who have encountered setup problems. as i said above, i have an unlocked blackberry 9930, an unlocked nokia 920 and an unlocked samsung galaxy 4, all purchased from amazon. please be aware that all unlocked phones have setup challenges that will be \"learning curve\" for the new buyer. here is some help for the bb 9930/9900.i believe most of my comments below would apply to 9900, but please be aware that the 9900 does not support cdma; the 9930 is both gsm and cdma capable.if you are getting the \"activation required\" message at the top of a verizon bb 9930 that is supposed to unlocked, the message is misleading. i eliminated this message as follows.there is a cdma screen for the 9930. you can access it by dialing ##000000 from your blackberry 9930, which will take you to the \"cdma service edit screen\", where you can edit some settings.edit the \"mobile directory number\" there (it may be blank or the some vestigial verizon phone number) and enter your phone number that you are using with your sim card. this eliminates the \"activation required\" heading at the top. be careful not to change anything else on this screen.internet browsing is accomplished as

using \"blackberry world\". note, you must be connected by wifi to use \"blackberry world\". search for and install \"opera mini\".(3) to minimize data charges, i keep \"data services\" turned off. i

for a friend and he loves it!! i am super happy that i got the samsung s5. i got it about 1 month ago from sce enterprise.i picked it for its camera, and i have been continuously impressed at the resolution. the system provides various special features, e.g. video stabilization, burst shots, face detection, and then the usual, white balance, iso, exposure value. the front facing camera is useful, good enough to skype.the processor is fast, turning it on and off takes about 30 seconds. i downloaded ~25 apps, and it runs fine.the speakers are not very loud, not enough for me to sing along during a shower.the charging portal is not a conventional one, which is unpleasant because i need to buy several more. and if i forget one when i am away from home, my friends won\\'t have extras.the battery life is pretty low, maybe 1 percentage decrease per 1.5 minutes. if i am watching something 3 hours straight, it would be dead. overnight, it goes down about 12 % just on standby. the battery is a regular samsung battery.i am on an at&t plan, and the phone adjusted smoothly. i had to go to the store to exchange for a smaller sim card, which took about 30 minutes. the only bump was when my data didn\\'t work due to an old apn. so, i added a new one for att and it works fine now.overall, i am super pleased. the lg g4 is a great smartphone, but you shouldn\\'t buy this model. this is the us991 version, and it\\'s just terrible. it comes on the latest android 6 version, witch is just a complete battery sucker, and the us991 version can\\'t be downgraded. you could do some adjustments in case you have root access to lower do battery consume of this android version, but you can\\'t unlock bootloader on the freaking us991 lg g4, so you can\\'t root as well. bottom line, don\\'t by this model of the phone, go for the h815 instead. you can never make through the day with this us991 version, and you will get avrg 2 hours and 30 minutes of screen on time at best. returned the product due to it appeared to have been opened and or used a bit. if it was not used the packaging and phone seem to had a bit of rough treatment. the feel of the phone didn\\'t \\'feel\\' very high quality either. this is a cute uograded phone from my samsung note 2. slimmer and sleek too. i had to buy another one for my mum...price was ok a=at&t; t=tmobile etc. although it\\'s unlocked, and both tmobile and att use gsm and this is a gsm phone, not everything that is usable on at&t may be useable on tmobile. i am finding this out the hard way with hours and hours of calls with samsung, tmobile, etc. i love this phone. a few of my close friends and family saw it liked it. the features and the price a big sell. very quick! have so many scratches. i think it was not in good condition. but it works great. nice phone, easy to setup, and brilliant quality. i love the 8mp camera. it was better than my android, and i know that\\'s for sure. i took the phone to at&t, had it activated, and ta-da!pros:*excellent 8mp rear camera with an awesome 1.2mp facetime camera*very responsive touchscreen with absolutely no lags*easy to transfer android items to iphone( if you are a previous android user)cons:*slippery plastic back but easily fixed if you buy a case awesome phone. screen is in perfect condition. item is exactly what is posted. very happy..i would recommend the seller again. excellent did not work! what a great phone for the price. i have a small business and use office 365. i previously had a very cheap flip phone for my business phone line, with cheap $10 a month voice service from puretalk usa. i wanted a windows phone so that i could more easily store and synchronize my contacts with my office 365 service. i figure that for $80, this phone would at least do the minimum for me. i am pleasantly surprised. i just popped my puretalk sim card into the phone, set up wireless, and i was in business. it now synchronizes everything i need on the phone and when i\\'m near some free wireless or at home, i can use the data services.this is a great low-budget way of having a business phone for $10 a month with no contract and no outrageous $600 phone.the phone itself is snappy and responsive. it came with a charger, usb cable, pair of earbuds, clear rubber protector, and an extra screen protector, in addition to the one already on the phone out of the box. i paired my bluetooth headset, and i\\'m ready for business. this is the second case i purchase and none fit. am so dissapointed good i received the phone and it appears to be unlocked but the reception is so poor i cannot place calls without them dropping. the phone also is rebooting during calls. i tried to contact the seller and if i want to exchange the phone i need to ship it back on my own.definitely go with another phone. recieved the brand new phone only to find out the hard way that no micro sim inserted into the sim card slot works at all. i get the message no sim card-emergency calls only. my service provider tried every micro sim they had and none worked. i even tried my sisters micro sim.av house is the seller by the way. please do not buy anything from these people. returned phone. did not meet requirements i wanted. great basic phone for whatsapp instagram messenger twitter facebook etr i bought it like \"new\" but it is not. it is refurbished and it suddenly stopped working the product is bad and faulty. currently not working. i am disappointed.i see that sept 5th was the deadline for return but that is unfortunate. i bought for my sister in africa and sent it to her. it didnt reach her until 20th of september, only to find out that the item is faulty and not in fair working condition i recently ordered a blackberry gemini 8520 unlocked gsm phone for use internationally. when i recieved said order, it in fact was not a gemini 8520, but a blackberry curve; of which i think may have been re-furbished. i didn\\'t want the hassle of returning the curve because i need to use a phone immediately. so i did not complain until i was asked to write a review of this item.thanks! ok i got it today, but i have a worry, my question is , is it open for any sim card from any country? coz i want to send it to cameroon to a cousin. please let me knowso i can order more excellent product, good care of seller. i recommend 100% an amazing phone. highly intuitive. super fast. excellent internal memory which can be expanded. lovely reception when talking. it has a great feel in hands - light, almost seems to conform to your palms as well - despite the size. i love it and the smart features are really cool. overall i really love the phone. great value in my opinion. keeper for a long time fancy good nice for its price i request and pay for a white one and i finally get one in black, that i found wrong in the phone . does what is says but it is a clunky big watch all good do not recommend. the publication was saying that the phone was new and not new, was already used and had stuck a protective film on the screen, and original plastic did not. arrived quickly and as advertised! a+ transaction, highly recommended bought 4. all of them came with supiciuos preinstalled glass protection. one of them for each family member (wife, me and sons). i came to the z3+ in order to have all of my chargers standarized. my z3 were a complete frustration about the magnetic conector (2 of them failed), but i still liked sony for having a nice android implementation. also wanted to be conected with all my family during my stay in usa, so i decided for dual sim version. two phones of the four i have bought have the touchscreen broken. i have realized of that as one of them stopped working properly after twoo weeks. in the past one dual sim z3 supiciusly failed after trying to get photos of my daghter in the pool. now, i have lose all confidence in dual sim versions selled on amazon with \"no warranty\". in the last twoo years 4 of the six phones i have bought failed (twoo z3 and twoo z3+). this has triggered the wish to move all family to iphones next year.update: 3 of 4 z3+ hace touchscreen broken! not what i expected good no problems. it is a really nice android phone! it has the most advanced google features. the phone doesn\\'t come with any pre-installed apps, which is great! because i never use the pre-installed apps in my old android phones. i really like all the google apps that the phone provides. the camera is also very nice. the do not disturb feature in the phone is better than any other phone i had. this is a great phone!! great phone at a great price good replacement part very good its not unlocked can t use all the feature volume poor quality wish i can return it love the phone. thanks it\\'s an iphone recieved certified refurbished phone genuine samsung charger and cord + new headphones and ear buds....but it would not register on t-mobile network because the \"seller/previous owner \" had an unpaid balance on the phone! excellent the home key is not work!!the home key is not work!!the home key is not work!!how can i do? perfect. delivered early. no problems whatsoever. very reliable. very user friendly , you can download skyfire and watch video with flash. the middle button works like a mouse and the ovi maps work great.it comes in handy when you are somewhere and you don\\'t have a gps. it will give you a sense of security. there is nothing on the market that has that much function and still made out of stainless steel and its super thin. only bad thing is that it doesn\\'t have touchscreen, but oh well for what it is its a great phone. i recommend this phone. this phone replaced a nexus 5 that suffered a cracked screen, so this review is based on my previous use of the n-5. overall, i like the 5x. the battery lasts longer than the 5\\'s did, and the picture quality of the 5x camera is visibly better than the 5\\'s. also, the fingerprint recognition feature is very convenient. most other performance is very similar to the n-5.what does bother me about the phone is the feel in my hand. the larger size, combined with a slimmer profile and lighter weight makes it feel like i\\'m going to drop the phone all the time. the side and back finish of the phone is supposed to be a soft-feel material for better gripping, but mine always feels somewhat slippery (i don\\'t keep my phone in a case). makes my buttons on my phone sluggish:( don\\'t advice anyone to buy it. doesn\\'t even charge i bought this samsung behold and after using it for about a year, it freezes up. i can\\'t make call or view anything on the phone, it\\'s useless now and waited my money. excellent product. i have been an android fan for a number of years, and this time i decided to give asus a try, leaving samsung galaxy aside for the time being. there were two main arguments in favor of my change: in the first place, my previous experience with asus (a very good notebook years ago) and, in the second place, a very reasonable price, when comparing it with other much more expensive phones with similar characteristics. up to now, the asus zenfone 3 ze552kl 64 gb has met all my expectations, always responding to the demands i make from it. furthermore, the phone has excelled regarding battery life.i must admit that i was quite worried for a moment when, after opening the box on arrival, i found that the tiny user\\'s guide was written only in chinese and that, upon turning the phone on, all text on it was also in chinese! fortunately for me, it was easy to change the language to english and to download an excellent user\\'s guide in english. things went smoothly after that.one final comment: i frequently interchange english and spanish when texting. the asus zen ui keyboard has proven excellent, and going from one language to the other is extremely easy. in addition to that, voice typing is absolutely wonderful. (i must say, however, that i do not know if this trait is to be ascribed to the asus zenfone itself, or if its merits are to be ascribed to the android 6.0.1 version.) it\\'s totally not the same like the one i bought many years ago from sony store. this does not look like a real phone. el telefono me llego el dia pautado. al abrirlo me fijo que el vidrio que protege la camara no lo trajo,le coloque la bateria para ver si todo estaba funcionando correctamente pero para mi sorpresa la bateria vino dañada. lo lleve a un sitio a que le dieran lo q llaman un choque a la baeria a ver si era que estaba muy descargada pero no funciono. tuve que comprarle una. al llegar a mi casa, espere que se descargara la bateria para realizar la primera carga y al conectar el cargador me lleve una segunda sorpresa pues el cargador tampoco sirvio. tuve que comprarle un cargador nuevo. luego de un mes comienzo a darme cuenta que la trackpad comenzo a quedarse pegada asi que lo lleve a un sitio especializado a cambiarsela cuando se supone que debe durar mucho tiempo. pero al pasar unos dias con la nueva trackpad me doy cuenta que se sigue pegando y lo vuelvo a llevar con un especialista en blackberry y al agarrarlo no solo me dijo que tiene algo mas dañado sino que el telefono esta reconstruido y yo lo compre como un telefono nuevo. tengo unos 2 meses con el telefono y no solo pague por el costo del telefono sino por la bateria nueva, el cargador nuevo, tracpad nuevo y de paso ya comenzo a apagarse. por eso solo le coloque una estrella. me estafo totalmente!! it came in excellent condition, works well with metro pcs worst phone i have ever owned. i bought this on july16 and the phone stopped working this morning. i should have realized it was horrible when it would not hold a charge and now it won\\'t charge at all. my phone is completely dead and use able. now i have to buy a new phone because in my job i cannot be without a phone. my customer and staff cannot get in touch with me. do not buy this phone. it\\'s junk for the price it is a good mobile. it is very good this watch is amazing. technology can\\'t get better than this. my son loves it. great seller, thanks for the phone! it\\'s a real pretty phone i just don\\'t think you can use this phone with t-mobile great phone for the price. the phone works ok. i thought i had a problem with the phone, it was the sim card. i was just about to return it but change my mind. everything as expected. love my s5 mini. beautiful phone, works great! bought phone for my mom she loves it great buy first one didn\\'t work seller sent me another one the second one work great wonderful, amazing product. love it brand new without a original case. it say unlocked,but it is locked and could not be used in my country :( :( i just bought this.phone less than a month ago and it already has stopped working. you. can\\'t download anything with a sd card. very good! the battery is completely fried and won\\'t hold a charge for very long. i don\\'t like this pocket pc. everything works, but its so slow... i allways close unnecesary opened applications, but it still slow. it seems to me that hp have to work on using a new processor, something about double the actual speed of 416 mhz. here are some observations:1. the phone works, just put your sim card and use it, thats ok. the problem is that the software and response time never compares with my previous sony ericsson phones, my last one was a w600i. you need both hands to operate it, if you are driving... looking for a phone number in contacts, call history or the speed dial, be careful, use your pocket pc phone can easily kill you... of course you can use a voice activation software that in my case, latin america, almost none of the automatic softwares works (accent i guess). if i\\'m dialing a number and the voice mail alert starts playing right before the recorder starts... it doesn\\'t matter if you press the end button, buttons are so slow in response that you have no time to place a miss call...2. the gps works just fine, but not with the hp applications... there are no maps for my country (panama)i used the gps tuner software and had to georeference some images from google earth.3. the hp 6945 freezes a lot, it is very anoying having to restard so often. some times it freezes when i\\'m receiving a call.4. the square screen is not good because some of my applications don\\'t work on it.5. the camera is really slow to start, very limited functionality and bad quality photos... if you want to waste good moments... just go and take pictures with this mediocre camera.6. the battery is very bad, you better keep on syncronizing very often or you\\'ll end up with out batteries very soon. there a lot of excuses like don\\'t use your blue tooth to often, dont use your gps because it\\'ll suck your battery, pay 55$ for a new bulky battery, stuf like that.7. i\\'m not planning to buy other hp pocket pc in the future, i\\'m so frustrated with this one. it seems that most of these unlocked international version phones are unlocked by the sellers themselves, who break the phone\\'s box seal, open the box, and unlock the phones themselves (note that samsung says \"do not accept if seal is broken\"). hence, technically, most of these unlocked international version phones are not really new. i bought a lot of samsung galaxy s7 edge phones from amazon, and most (not all) had the seal broken.on the phone itself, this is the best phone i have ever tried. slick, light, balanced, fantastic screen, fast, water proof, and so on .... its only caveat (and an important one) is the lack of removable battery (samsung lost the removable batter starting with the s6). i like this phone much better than the edge. the s7 edge has a bigger screen, but the resolution is the same as with the s7, and its edges are highly annoying, making one touch them by mistake constantly. furthermore, the edge\\'s edges make it very difficult to properly protect the phone with a case - not a problem with the regular s7.finally, the only difference between the g930f (single sim version) and the g930fd (dual sim version) is that in the latter the slot where the micro card goes is also enabled to accept a second sim card, which is recognized by the device\\'s os. for what it is i guess it has it\\'s good features, but it won\\'t send or receive multimedia texts. the screen is very small and the images are not that clear. the flashlight is cool and the battery life is great. i wouldn\\'t buy it again though. do not buy this phone! you will find countless reports of this \"flagship device\" falling to the boot-loop defect online. lg has acknowledged the issue and claims they will repair affected phones in 7-9 business days if you have a warranty. without a warranty, you are buying a defective phone that will make a nice paper weight in six months. verey good thank you device was as described, arrived quickly and has been working like a charm over the last several months that i\\'ve had it. very pleased. doesn\\'t like the washing machine at all! the phone works fine but it\\'s not possible to set it in spanish, it only can be set in english or asian languages. i dislike the blu phone amazing phone is not unlocked! i had second thoughts on a refurbished product, but worked perfectly with no problems. totally recommended, just have in mind that the box is not the original box. perfect mobile , i found what i want and more the speed , its camera , the application all are very goodthe seller is is perfect also. i can say this mobile is better than others include iphone 6 in almost perfect shape (some light wear on the battery cover, nothing that you can see very clearly). happy with the phone. no sound quality problems as others have reported. great for those searching for a basic phone. no internet, no camera, bigger lettering. amazing value got it early and love it just what i needed i\\'ve tried samsung, htc, motorola and this sony is by far the most superior phone i\\'ve ever had. this model is mid range ,i can\\'t imagin what a top of the line sony would be like.xperia fan for life greay ok i love this phone! i\\'m not a big cell phone gamer, nor do i use my cell phone as a photo storage device. i use only the basic functions of the cell phone, phone calls, texts, facebook, sometimes skype, some browsing... this phone provides everything i need and the speed is amazing! the finger print feature is pretty interesting. i also like the camera a lot! product was received as described and it worked perfectly lots of great features, and even though it flips 2 ways, it is durable.young teens tend to be a little tough on phones. at least in our experience.our daughter is thrilled! great little phone camera on the front is just as good as the back too better that the studio x and xplus that ive bought, its a keeper not a good buy for me, have to return it to amazon. i tried buying a tmobile or att sim card on line and after entering the imei number received the message that the imei isn\\'t valid and that the device is unusable and i should buy another device. i like the cell good settings asus really highly recommend this phone in all aspects now tell you just i found the bad of this phone is the battery is a little hard crap 6-7 hours if you use a lot the internet is consumed as a car 12 cylinder consume gas is amazing reduce one percent every 10 minutes or so i have just one month in and i already sell soon , pay attention to the battery is not good quality very bad do not hold the charge really i do not recommend this phone, thanks very good! thanks i like it not much to say. it is exactly what the description says it is. worked with 4 different carriers in 2 different countries. i love it great phone. camera lacks a little, speaker lacks a little. but your paying very little for what you get. a++ it\\'s fast, the battery life it\\'s good for me (almost 2 days or more) and i love the camera.the whatsapp have some problems but it\\'s not a phone trouble for sure this one is my wife\\'s. for overall use, loves it. but she really wanted an improved camera and video over our previous lumia phones.yes, camera has better resolution. but....audio recording gets blasted out in loud environments, which the nokia did not. so...meets the needs for talk/text/apps...does not for her quality pictures and video under certain conditions. probably better than average for it\\'s price point. the best or nothing :)) fine, that\\'s what i am waiting for great! i love it! love my lg g2 the phone works fine and great but i have a big question. will it ever upgrade to marshmallow 6.1? my second cell phone with android system and it is good for its price seller is lying about warranty. phones are sold past warranty. you will not be able to get any help from the manufacturer, and they will charge you at least $40 just to take a look if anything should go wrong. many comments show the phone consistently has problems 3-6 months past purchase.i ordered this phone february of 2012. it initially functioned fine, though the cosmetics (plastics on the surface, colored designs &c) came off within a few weeks. i had trouble with the charger within a month of ordering - it did not fit snugly into the phone but buying another usb chrarger solved the problem.after 3 months, the phone has started to reboot constantly and always reverts to \"earlier\" states - losing recent messages, pictures &c. it seems like the storage card (microsd inside the phone, inaccessible without voiding warranty) may have gotten loose. some searching told me this seems to be a common problem with htc windows 7 phones. my phone is currently bricked with a \"storage card not working\" error message.i called htc and they told me the phone\\'s warranty expired in november 2011, months before i purchased it and that i have no recourse except to send it in for out of warranty evaluation. once they look at it, they will quote me a price, usually between $100-150, and if i decide against it, i will be charged $40 for my troubles.i feel silly having bought this phone despite numerous reviews that have cited this exact problem. heed these warnings! this product come in perfect condition, with original charger and unlocked, i recomend100% i was a little disappointed at the beginning, thinking i was getting a 4s. but when i checked back on the item description, i realized that it was a 4 the whole time- i just didn\\'t read it well.either way, i have enjoyed the 32gb of space, enabling me to put more music on my phone.i was able to unlock this phone easily with at&t. as a dual sim android phone, its awesome, but once you load it up with apps the 8gb memory disappears very quickly - even with the movement of most apps to sd. also bluetooth fails me continually, but runs better if i keep over 1.5gb of space in storage. if you don\\'t use bluetooth functionality (daily) its a brilliant phone. all this being said i may just have a defective phone. the amazon supplier is great, quick delivery. this is an inexpensive, but truly excellent phone. i just returned from a trip to costa rica. the phone is small, light weight, worked instantly with the sim i purchased at the airport. the sound quality is superior, i traveled all over the country. the ring was loud and even my husband who has poor hearing was able to use the phone and hear clearly. we called the usa and those calls came in loud and clear. the phone held phones numbers and was easy and user friendly. i was able to text, write notes, talk and it had other features. i highly recommend this purchase! this phone is everything i thought it would be nothing wrong with it all came on time and packaged perfectly.the only thing this phone is not supported by boost mobile,the phone company ive had for 2 years so i had to transfer to metro pcs so if you have boost think about it i transfered for just my first months bill no extra charges so yeah this phone is perfect great handset for a very resonable cost. great deal on the phone. item came very well packed. the item meets its intended purpose. this phones radios don\\'t seem to work right! on auto gsm wcdma it\\'ll get stuck on edge... when it gets stuck it doesn\\'t go back to 3g or hspa without manually registering it on the t- mobile network! i even called t-mobile and manually put in the apn settings and no dice! it lags a little bit on transitions too. just a little tho! aside form that it\\'s a pretty good phone! extremely happy even though it doesn\\'t look as elegant and rich as the htc one, it is indeed more useful with the amazing features and the fast processor. it is very nice. worth every quarter of a penny!the motion features run smooth with a little bit of practice.htc one vs s4the only thing which is highlighted in htc one is the built quality and the camera.the s4 too has a nice camera but a poor built quality. it makes up because of a bunch of features great phone evening was there. my husband loves those excellent product!!! i had s4 and now s7, very satisfied again! excellent. product work well, as per specification except for a minor battery model difference. apart from that the mobile works perfect. excellent fast delivery. i love my new iphone, i would recommend this to anyone looking to buy a smart phone. such a great deal too. thank you! i love it especially with dual sims so i can have to number. instead of carrying 2 phone. i always have samsung galaxy with my daughter from 2,3,5, & 6 everything perfect! this is a simple phone that did exactly what i need it to....turn on and off allow me to make and receive calls while my phone was out of service. because it is unlocked, i can also share it with family in the event they need a temporary solution to stay in touch! appreciate having it! description stated - \\'brand new in original retail box, phone has original plastic screen with all accessories have original packaging\\'. the phone i received was not in retail package. it was a generic htc package and the phone did not even have the plastic wrap. there was a sticker in the back of the phone. nb 08/13. research on the internet comes up as new breed refurbished phone inspected on 08/13. there is no warranty information nor user manual. i opted to buy this phone as the order was fulfilled by amazon. the phone did not have any visible damage and so far in the past 4 days i did not have issues and the windows update went well. this is why i\\'m keeping this phone. there is always a disappointment when you receive the product not per the description. so buyers keep this in mind while ordering. you can easily find factory refurb models else where for around 175 or less do not buy a samsung galaxy grand prime because it i\\'s not what they say they are... it done not load or work like it i\\'s supposed to... very very unhappy with this phone. bought for my daughter. great value, in great condition. she loves it. general:comes shipped for another language but that\\'s to be expected as the p705 was intended for the chinese market, works 100% on t-mobile so far - look to your carrier\\'s website to see how to program your phone to connect to their data/mms services, else it will not work, you must tell it where to connect - it is not a fault in the phone.design:the phone is flat and square which is good because it slips in your pocket comfortably, the back isn\\'t as \\'grippy\\' as it seems it might be - a case or replacement back may solve this (i am used to the back of my google nexus 7 with it\\'s less-than-plastic backing).the buttons don\\'t sit out too far; just enough to identify and press when needed. the battery back is a little difficult to remove without a tool or fingernails as it does not slide off, rather than snapping on. this becomes a problem when needing to access the microsd slot which for some people may be often (stock android connects to your computer via mtp or media transfer protocol which means it doesn\\'t allow the same ease of use as say a thumb drive and in the case of windows 7 makes you confirm every file you copy over that it might not work on your device. there is also software you may download from lg for the device to transfer and backup data.)specs, performance:the battery is as robust as to be expected, using apps, texting and such, i find i really only need to charge every other day, but this is no problem since i rarely find myself lost in the wilderness for a week.actual battery life varies per user and the things running and connecting of course. a user smart with their battery would see days on standby, surprisingly as much as i personally turn on to mess around with the screen on, (brightness at 28%, still very clear. the screen can get very bright.) the screen is the fourth on the list of things that pull power to my battery. the top items on my phone: cell standby, android system, phone idle and finally the screen. in the other devices i have used (primarily tablets), the screen is usually the top pulling item, by grand leaps. this isn\\'t the case with the p705, the screen is rather easy on battery life.power-wise, as noted, my other android device is a nexus 7 so i feel it\\'s apples and oranges, however the p705 holds its own against it, very few lags and no hang-ups, though i mind to restart my phone every couple days to clear out and let it start fresh. installing nova launcher on as my default home, it performs with minimal lag, though i notice a slight stutter on screen transitions (primarily the \"swinging door\" transition.) the default launcher performed well, however, an lg customized ics launcher. nothing too spectacular, hence the upgrade to nova launcher. runs most apps without issue, have not tested many games outside of osmos, which proved to make the game stutter - it\\'s definitely not a gaming phone.depending on your carrier, connection will always vary, however the p705 gets rather good connection that i have found so far, on average, i get better reception than i did with most of my previous phones. wifi isn\\'t terrible, i don\\'t lose signal nor find that i get better performance than my nexus, either.the speaker isn\\'t terribly loud but it would work well enough to carry out a speakerphone conversation as well as you won\\'t miss a call due to not hearing it. the battery was damaged... had to buy a new one i\\'ve been on android forever and this is my first iphone... i love it! i was nervous to switch from my beloved samsungs, but i don\\'t regret this at all. it took a day or two to get adjusted to navigating the phone, but that is to be expected. i still reach for my back button lol. i just wanted a phone that is reliable and doesn\\'t glitch out... and for some reason i wasn\\'t impressed by the edge screens on the new flagship galaxy phones. i figured it would be a good time to buy an iphone since the release of the iphone 7 caused the price to drop on older models.with ios 10 installed, i don\\'t feel like i\\'m wanting to instantly go back to my android. the display is beautiful even compared to the super amoled displays on other phones. they are both gorgeous in their own ways, and the 6+ is still very bright, colorful, and crisp. everything is very fluid, beautiful to navigate, and the apps are so nice to look at! this phone just works. i\\'m impressed with the battery life as well and i hope this phone lasts for a while. this is scam !i ordered an iphone 6s 16gb \"new - brand new ! sealed!\" but i recieved an used phone which does not even work.it turned on just once, 3d touch wasn\\'t responding that well and phone is completely dead now.i\\'m not even sure if this phone is apple\\'s real&original product.amazon is refusing to replace an item and also problems about refund.i\\'m soo dissapointed. i was skeptical at first but went ahead and placed the order. iphone came factory sealed and delivery was 2days as stated in the description. item as described. pictures are very nice and sharp. the only problem with the rezound phone is that they normally are not very good for detecting the gps signal. my previous phone has the same problem but my husband one has always been working well (he use different brand). i would still recommend this phone unless you use the gps often. the weight and size of this phone are ideal in my opinion. it is also very very fast, water resistant, very good battery life, looks very good, unreal 4k video(tested and impressed... pausing the video looks like a photo even on a large monitor), has a clear sharp display, great audio and a fantastic (for a phone) camera. i loved my sony zl phone, got it wet so then went to the z1 which is great but too big and heavy for me. this is the best phone out there for my needs right now and i believe this size of phone will make a huge comeback as it is truly ideal, great job sony! (ps i am on t-mobile and i don\\'t think i am getting lte but still quite fast and battery drain is not an issue) it\\'s an ok phone fast service and quality product.great stuff here you guys rock the has a short battery life. i am constantly recharging. the phone take too long to power up. i am strongly considering selling it and get another brand. i\\'m loving my new blackberry leap! the touch screen is the best for productivity, the virtual keyboard is so quickly and the battery life is awesome. i purchased this phone a while back, my opinion on this phone is that it was not what i have asked for. when i ordered the cellphone it clearly stated that it was \"unlocked\", when i turned on the phone, a verizon screen came on, i saw it very strange that the screen came on with a verizon sign on. as i put the sim card in, it said it could not be read because it is not verizon. at that very moment, i contact amazon and i told them about the problem and said i should chose another phone than wait to exchange it for another. i really suggest people to read the reviews because don\\'t end up like how i ended up. all i needed was something to text and make phone calls on and to that end it does as expected. voice dial works better than my last \"dumb\" phone. the physical keyboard is a big plus as i hate virtual keyboards with no \"feel\". battery life is very good at about 4-5 days.sorry, if you have to surf and e-mail, you\\'re really out of luck here.does exactly what i needed and at a great price. my son loves this phone. he uses it for an mp3 player and its his own piece of heaven. good deal bought two of these one in november and the other in december. both of them are acting up ie the screen freezes or blanks out periodically. the slot for the headphones is not working. would not buy a blu again. going back to samsung! just as described. no scratches, works 100 %, new , perfect cellphone. its missing a sim card and i haven\\'t been able to find one anywhere for it. the product was not good, it always went off and the screen did hang most of the time. even at the moment the screen is static for the last two weeks, i cannot call anyone or swipe to do anything with the phone. well it would have been a 4 star, however, the microphone has quit working after 3 months of use (bought in may 15). pick up of sound is a shot in the dark, did factory reset but this did not fix problem. i will be sending email to manufacture to get repair info. so the \"hear me now\" does not apply anymore.at7t lte availability: need to check your providers frequency for lte, on my travels, this phone was not able to receive lte in metro areas i visited. the reason for this it is lacking the 700mhz lte band in which there other product the blue studio mini 5.0 has.battery life. i found the battery lasted reasonably well for the day when not on charge.. a suggestion, if you are at your desk, buy a usb cable or extension power cord to keep it charged. its perfect and excellente price, factory unlock and sealed condition! it is great and a good choice to every people thank you for the wonderful phone. i was giving this phone as a gift and i really appreciate the great service has some glitches, but works 80% great. the battery life is amazing. i get full 2 days. with a battery saver app, it goes for 3 days on a long weekend. it is sufficiently fast for me. exelente to bad it was palm\\'s \"hail mary\", and it didn\\'t go as well as they wanted it to. and now that hewlett packard has purchased palm, and is all but ignoring this phone, it\\'s quickly degrading to the point where it will be nearly useless before it actually wears out. sad ... like i say, this \"was\" the best phone ever.addendum: hp has now disabled google maps on this phone, and re-routes any requests for map information to \"bing\". this also disables dozens and dozens of other apps that depended on the google maps api. hewlett packard has gone beyond simply ignoring this phone, and is now actively disrupting it\\'s original functionality. there are class action law suits in the works, but nothing will ever come of them. hp has simply ruined the best phone ever. still working and that is all that counts. :) no memory even after adding 32 gb to it still can\\'t download anything the charger that brings the phone comes with problems and not burden and also has problems microphone output, not recommended because pay for something new and seems used the phone is pretty, but lots of time the other person cannot hear me, sometimes it rings and sometimes it don\"t. it has a problem with charging i have brought to different charger and they still don\"t connect tight. i called my sprint services and ask is there a problem with the sprint system and they said no. exelent the phone seemed great. the problem was, my chip would not fit because it was an att phone, and i have t-mobile, and, i didn;t see a choice on amazon, where i could tell them i need a tmobile phone. i ordered the phone, it said it would work with my company(some gp something), but, it didnt say, yes, it will work with your t-mobile account. never said exactly, that it would. i\\'m sure the phone was great. i love samsung. i\\'m scared to re-order, because, i tried specifically to say a t- mobile phone, but, i felt like the descriptions did not assure me it would work with my chip. so. i gave up... i love it ! very gd stay away with this product, after plug in my t-mobile sim card, it cannot recognize any internet connect at all, even 2g,3g... no internet connection, definitely this is a buggy one, and i have to pay for the international return shipping fee, seller is not responsible for this, u take risk by your own i ordered the silver iphone 6s 64 gb from fgs trading. the phone came in good time. it was indeed internationally unlocked and worked in jamaica. the phone is beautiful and works great! would definitely recommend!!! excellent muy bueno i like the phone so far. screen is a little touchy at times. i like the free clear protector that came with it,but i am ordering a new type of case that may help with that when it is in my pocket.otherwise it works fine. it was great great excellet! we signed up with consumer cellular and received a simple motorola phone, which we got good signal reception. no dropped calls, no problems. we wanted to cancel our wired phone and dial-up internet connection, so we purchased the samsung galaxy s duos s7562 to use as a phone and an internet hotspot for our computers. the duos was not receiving any signal and it wasn\\'t until i worked with consumer cellular tech support, that i discovered it was not really misconfigured or broken. by climbing to the roof on a nearby building, i was able to connect and place a telephone call. it reminds me of the \"green acres\" telephone situation, which was mounted on a phone pole, due to the lack of wire, at the time of installation. other than that, the device looked neat and might be fine for someone who lives and works in a strong signal area. this may or may not reflect on the results you get with your own samsung galaxy phone. i\\'ve been using his phone for over a month now and i absolutely love it. yes, the display is small but it\\'s super colorful. the google play store, lets you download plenty of apps that are compatible with this device.however it is a 4g phone, and my sim is capable of lte meaning i am not used to the slowness of the data. if you\\'re connected to wifi there shouldn\\'t be a problem, and if you\\'re used to 4g data then then you should be okay.it has a 2 mega pixel main camera and a vga front camera, and if you came here for a good camera... well probably not the best place to look. the main camera typically gets the job done however.with 4gb of internal memory, adding an sd card is a good idea especially if you love music and lots of apps. i haven\\'t used very much of the data so i don\\'t have many complaints.the charger is mini usb but the metal part of the charger that connects to the phone is a tad longer than your average usb so don\\'t break it or lose it.overall it\\'s a very good media player and i don\\'t regret purchasing it. i hope this review helps! good seller and god product very serius have issues with calls dropping and screen freezing along with staying in 4g lite. i have my samsung note for work so i know that it is available. it destroyed my 64gig sd card where i had my pictures and music saved. i bought 2 of these phones with the assumption that i would have lollipop by now. by the time that happens it will probably more version after marshmallow. called customer service and the are clueless on if/when it will upgrade. come to think of it my sd card bit craps that next day(something to ponder). though the phone barely has any scratches or mishandling marks, the iphone i received has a bad case of ghost tapping. minus this annoying factor, the iphone runs smoothly and the battery last as long as any other iphone. the battery is horrible! hardly holds an hour charge. the camera kicks rocks. blurry photos. other than that i have no problems with it. except there is no swype. oh, and the internet is slowww...wifi connection is good though. and i do love the neon pink color..but the battery kills the deal. returning it..well, back to samsung i go. i hate paying for their high a__ phones :( very happy with my iphone. i bought this phone the first day it came out, because i really wanted to have a big screen and my lg g5 only have a 5.3 screen, i am currently using it with cricket wireless and i get signal almost everywhere.pros:-screen alone is 5 stars, is amazing, good quality, good brightness even outside, great whites, love the edgeless design, i\\'m glad sony still uses lcd panels because amoled screens are prone to burn in.-phone is fast, i haven\\'t experience any slowness or lag, everything opens really fast.-speaker sound is really nice and loud another 5 stars for it.-battery life is the same or better than my lg g5, so i cant really complain here.-call quality is good, signal is good as wellcons:-only 16gb of internal memory, this is my main concern this phone deserves a least 32gb of internal memory, i downloaded a couple games and i only have 1 gb left. unfortunately you cant install apps directly to sd card. you can move some apps to sd card only if the developer allowed it, so some apps wont let you move them to the sd card. so this is a big downside.-hard to find quality cases and screen protectors-miss tap to wake a lot, i think this is one of the reasons i miss my lg g5-miss fast charging, this is the other reason i miss my lg g5 lol.anyways this is a great phone i have no regrets on buying this phone even though i paid full price for it, the only reason i\\'m not giving it 5 stars is because this phone deserved more internal storage and a bigger battery.update 1:after a flawless one week use, this last week the phone started experiencing problems. for some reason as others have said before, the cell radio turn off on their own for no apparent reason. i noticed this only happened when enabling lte mode on crickets (att\\'s network) so unless sony fixes this before my return period, ill keep it otherwise i will return phone. otherwise this is a fantastic device.update 2:sony issued an update which fixed the lte dropping issue, now this phone is perfect i got this watch on amazon about 3 or four months ago be aust i thought it was simpler to the apple watch... but boy was i wrong!!!!!, instead save your almost $30 and buy the mtk2502c it\\'s a fake version of the apple watch, it\\'s water proof, has a heart rate sensor and looks exactly the same as the apple watch and its only $74 my lock button dont work but other then that its a very good phone very good phone for the price. .i will be buying another very nice and good cell for unlocked. seller is awesome and would do business again. phone performs great even with its mid to low end specs. the screen is great. sharp and bright with nice viewing angles. the only thing that might bother some people is the ui isn\\'t the smoothest. it is still very livable without skipping many frames. it doesn\\'t bother me at all. overall, awesome phone for the price. worked right away with my t- mobile sim card. i bought this for father who lives overseas. he loves it. even at this age, he can use the product without any problem. the product is very excellent love this phone. my son in law recommended it, i am so glad he did. it works well i loved the phone while it was working... i bought in the us and brought home (brazil). i could use for 30 days, and now the phone is locked in the nokia screen and wont work!! i am a bit terrified cause brazilian nokia support may not help me to solve this problem or charge me like the price of a new one!! (really hope i am wrong and they will help us customres) :( i hope i can post what will happen cause i am contacting the support now.i also sent an email to amazon hoping they can help me out or also will try with nokia in the us....i will rate 1 star for this case but usually for all nokia celphones i use 5 stars!! hope i can change to 5 in a bit! :)lets see :( the only reason i gave it 2 stars was because it was in good physical condition. the phone would not activate or even recognize a at&t signal. not unlocked and not useful. sent back and gave up after reading endless other negative reviews. these used phone peddlers are definitely the bad apples in amazons barrel. thanks good. very good :) goood was not the color it looked like the phone was junk. whenever i put the sim card in, and then the battery on top, it would slightly move the sim card and not have it register. it took five or six times to get the cover on where the sim card wouldn\\'t slide in the spot. i wasn\\'t sure at first if it was due to the phone or the card, but i do now believe it was the phone. besides that, the charger didn\\'t charge. i had it plugged in for over 10 hours and it didn\\'t charge at all.it was too close to the start of my international trip to return and get another one. i wish i would have bought a better phone - that extra money would have saved me some headaches of not having one when i arrived overseas.would not recommend this to anyone. as expected i gave it one star because the lg g3 is a very good phone, however the one i received was factory locked :( using the unlock access code (for lg g3 (d855), enter 2945#*855#) i got to the manufacture lock screen where i was greeted with \"this phone is permanently locked and can not be unlocked\" dismiss. amazon is handling the return and refund beautifully and i will be ordering a new phone thru my service provider. great i must say there customers service is very good and they are doing everything possible to resolve my problem. so as a result i will recommend everyone to shop with wireovia we got an iphone 4s and are very happy with the product. it came in an unopened package as advertised. we took it to verizon and had no trouble getting our number transferred to it. would definitely buy from these guys again. placed in the description that are new, and come with many stripes and details. dealfisher seller i guess i would not break any news by saying that samsung does a great hardware. the phone is great to hold, looks nice, works fast and smooth. still, comparing it to my nexus 5, i like bare android more than samsung\\'s wrapper.this phone was purchased for my wife, who made a transition from iphone to android, and it\\'s quite good as such:it\\'s elegant, right size (not the huge screen of other current phones), fast. the battery life is ok, but i would easily trade 0.5mm more width for bigger battery. excellent excellent! this phone was reported stolen and is on the at&t blacklist and is blocked from network use. it doesn\\'t work even for at&t like it said it would. i talked to an at&t personnel and she looked up the phone and it was reported stolen. after having the phone for 1 month it quit working. not sure if this is a real samsung or a clone, but this phone is a piece of crap! don\\'t want to go through the trouble of returning it but i should. the signal is always in and out, and none of my bluetooth devices are able to connect to this model. this isn\\'t my first blu phone but all i can really say is i for sure got what i paid for this time around! i\\'m not big on phones or tech and i still wouldn\\'t recommend this phone to anyone. i bought this phone for my wife as a birthday present this year. i would give it a five star but its lack of handling apps gives it a 4. battery dies fast when you use apps on it. she has it running with net10 service and it works great! she loves it and overall its a great buy! bought this phone for my 12 year old son. was not sure it was going to do the trick, but it has :) very happy with our purchase. my nexus 5x got boot failure problem after a half year passed, and i found the repair service horrible.it took almost a month to get nexus 5x back, and it didn\\'t mean it was repaired. after the 1st \"repair\", boot failure problem was fixed but the speaker was completely broken. after the 2nd \"repair\", it came back without sim tray.if you really want to buy nexus 5x and don\\'t want to spend almost 2 months without your phone, i recommend you to buy it with nexus protect option from google store, which would provide immediate replacement. nice phone overall: after a bit over a month of usage, i\\'d call it ok.pros: it works. it has a camera and video player.cons: the video player is not what i expected. key pad is small. the view on the tiny screen is so-so.okay, i admit, i haven\\'t used the phone a lot yet or gotten greatly familiar with it. i was looking for a phone that i could use in the u.s. and abroad, where i am living and working now, and i was looking for one i could use to record video/audio without having to lug around another device. (is there a device out there for under $300, let\\'s say, that has an unlocked quad-band phone--not one that comes with the purchase of two-year cell phone plan, a pda, and a decent video camera all in one?)video record--20 secs at a time:the big disappointment was the video record. i was looking forward to having it available when i\\'m out and about and want to record something unexpected happening, which is fairly often in nairobi. it records for only 20 seconds at a time. one time it didn\\'t even capture the audio. and, when i converted the videos to my computer, they were the inky dinkiest little things i ever imagined. i can only pray that the audio will at least record--there are times when all i really want is to record some sound...russian:the phone, books, and keypad came in russian. now, of all the languages they could have chosen, russian was a good one for me, since i have a masters in it. i can see how that might be a bit tough though for someone who doesn\\'t know a language. maybe they should provide some quickee instructions with the phone on switching the phone to english. just a thought... the keypad in russian is a little annoying. maybe someday i\\'ll be so familiar with the keypad that i don\\'t need to look, but, alas, i have just gotten into txting the last couple years living in kenya, where it\\'s really cheap. so, some of the russian letters that look like english letters throw me off at times.keypad:i am coming from a simple nokia phone whose keypad was very nice for my fingers. i do not have big fingers, but the krzr keypad is too small and hard to use for my taste.mp3 player:plays quite well...nice...i like it. i will look forward to using that in my car in kenya...much easier than dealing with cds (even if i had a cd player in the car). not sure how that will suck the battery power--will have to find out.microsd card--no more than 2gb:i did see this somewhere later, but, do realize the phone supports no more than a 2gb card. i got a 4gb--doesn\\'t work. the 2gb works great.i haven\\'t tried the phone yet in nairobi, where i will be using it extensively. so, basically, the jury is still out... just wanted to give you my initial thoughts. first phone did not work i called them and they were great they did every thing to make me happy and to fix the problem. i would have no problem ordering from them again in the future i was very happy with this company. very good morning,best regards ..(amazon order: 105-8269691-6280222)i communicate with you by this route in order to notify the following:the equipment purchase was removed from the offices of liberty venezuela the 10th of may this year, to be on the phone the same present fault with the button on and blocking it does not work, additionally constantly appears on the screen window \"phone options\" (shutdown, restart, airplane mode) does not allow me to manipulate the phone as this window is constatemente, if to turn off the phone is not possible since the button located on the upper right side not work.much appreciate an answer to my problem in such a way to comply with the warranty.thankshappy daynayibet moreno it works great! i love it i like the phone, just wish there were more options for accessories very happy with items. received as advertised. extremely slow u can\\'t hold any data great value for money. plus it is stylish. the iphone is great. just like it appeared, that\\'s how i got it. it\\'s a great product. i would absolutely recommend this company to anybody. great shape very good value to me it is the best small affordable smart phone on the market. it suits my needs. i bought my first iphone off of amazon back in january and i still have it- no problems with it- good as brand new! i traded it out for my old phone on my verizon plan way before my 2-year-upgrade was due (because really, who can wait that long?!). worked like a charm. highly recommend. came fast and works really good great phone... arriving at time. one of the best phone in 2014 and still serve me good. love everything about this phone except for no micro sd slot and limited internal memory (i got the 16gb model). i had purchased an iphone 4 which was advertised as a verizon phone. it was an at & t phone and i had to return it i wanted to like this phone but i don\\'t. i hate it. it did not even survive a year. the phone literally took a $@!& and died the next morning. i am assuming it\\'s the charging port because the battery did not spin when i attempted the \"spin test.\" i love it great. i personally like the phone but wish i would of picked a different phone because it messes up a lot. it glitches to much and dies wayyy faster the nit should but overall its ok just ok i will be getting a new phone again soon but this will do. 3 stars works great and i am plased love this phone!!! good product is excellent, very fast, only cons is indoor pics are not that clear i am very happy whith my new phone. amazing, when i compare with my old one. phone worked great! nearly perfect condition! very satisfied it\\'s been 2 and a half hours two things stop working sleeping monitor and predometer on this watch really ????? i need my money back pliz great phone. it is hard to use with one hand unless you have very large hands. but using this makes me use my ipad mini less. everything met my expectations just wish a case was sent based on the purchase price however i\\'m loving my phone especially the security features i was not happy with the watch....i bought it has a gift and it has failed to work properly. works like a charm. love blu products - well made without being a wallet breaker. i\\'m wondering if my phone is even new.... starting to regret buying this phone & i just received it today. i cant even silence the camera shutter sound... love this phone. happy with this phone good works grate i was pleasingly surprise to find out this phone has the latest androind os.it was relatively cheap and dual sim card. great size. i appreciate how it fits in my pocket and purses. however, the battery does not stay charged all day.... works perfect! funciono perfectamente...it worked perfectly other users don\\'t like the operating system, it does not have millions of apps available like the iphone or android phones have, but there are still plenty of apps available and if you are willing to pay for the apps there are plenty. i even find the voice recognition for text messages and bing searches understands my voice better than siri does on the iphone. the camera is what makes this phone worth the money, with so many different modes it is easy even for novice camera users.only reason for 4 stars is that with the camera grip, there is basically no protective case available for the phone. you have to remove the camera grip for a protective case to fit. ordered a used phone from them. it arrived in almost brand new condition with charger. there was no box or manual but it was really easy to figure out. the phone itself is not impressive but it\\'s very rugged and is a great replacement with a clean esn. would order from them again. excellent quality, only real problem the gps signal is not very strong excellent item ... just need more ram, for greater capacity and will this company is selling duplicate products under wrong brand names. i have purchased a samsung galaxy s duos, it wasn\\'t working, when it took it to samsung authz dealership for repair, the advised me that, it\\'s a duplicate phone. i have asked to them to refund my money but they have refused. someone needs to take action or file a suite against them... teach them a lesson... i bought this phone and had it sent to a us address where my parents live and they shipped it over to germany where it works flawlessly. unfortunately the company refuses to send the phone to military po addresses, even though they are us addresses, so i had to do ti this way. as a side note, that kind of baffles me because it\\'s an internationally unlocked phone. anyway, it\\'s lightweight and (in my opinion) beautiful. the back is plain but i don\\'t mind because i bought it so i\\'d have a great phone, not necessarily an overly pretty phone, plus i always use a case. it works quickly and i haven\\'t had any software or app problems on the phone.my few small complaint are:1. the interface is not like your typical android, but i got used to it quickly and i personally enjoy the uniqueness it offers. i haven\\'t tried to use widgets because i don\\'t care about them, but i doubt they\\'d work on here.2. there is no app tray, so all your apps are forced to display on the screens which i didn\\'t like at first, but also grew accustomed to.3. lastly, i\\'m unable to delete the weather app/widget that comes on the phone (shown at top of screen in photo) and it never properly updates so i\\'ve learned to ignore it entirely.recently i started having issues with the gps constantly searching and it not working properly for navigation apps (but finding me perfectly fine and quickly for check-ins), but my husband\\'s sony phone has been doing this too and they started roughly around the same time. this could be user error (lol) or service provider error, so i\\'m not sure if it has anything to do with the phone. it worked fine initially.i\\'m excited to test out its dual sim capability on a visit to the us this month! i bought two devices and one battery was missing. both came preloaded with kind of custom light os for setting up which i had to disable. the scroll button of one of them moved a little bit down after 1 month of use but still works. they are truly unlocked. i\\'m using them outside us. it is not worth 146 usd i paid each. regards. the phone works perfect. my son loved it!!! the shipment is really fast and don\\'t have problem with activating it. thank you!!! awesome!! the quality of the actual product was very nice and sturdy. the only problems i had with this product was that the bluetooth kept disconnecting every few minutes. the step counter would reset every so often without me prompting it to. it is a nice phone for a low price the phone is in good condition. the only complaint i have is that the battery dies quickly, but that might just be an iphone thing. excellent phone had 2 weeks and in that time froze up always shut down and after 2 weeks completely froze up and is worthless ... absolute garbage waist of money great phone! pay for rm-1072 and recieve an rm-1073. i love this phone. you gotta like it before buying it in order to love it. firsts days the battery died pretty quick but once you get used to get the most out of it it can hold the day with decent usage. installed a 32 gb micro sim card and runs without problem. once i got more used to it, i could surf the web faster and type all kind of messages even faster. the screen can be as bright as you want but for battery life is better to have it very dim. signal and data transfer works fine, also the hot spot app is very easy to use and can be used while taking a call. everything at the same time. overall i\\'m satisfied with this phone.and for the last but not least this phone is on the list of motorola to recieve ics update this year. looking forward for more functions, hopefully battery saving and new functions!. one of the best phones i have ever had love the extra memory. try as i might i can not fill up the 32gb of memory. its a verizon phone , with option to get it partially working with other company sim.i always get verizon logo with message this is not a verizon sim.i would\\'t call it unlocked. or put it under this category. love my lg g3 d855 excellente so my daughter said she wanted a new phone with a physical keyboard because her phone was to sow at texting . i told her go find one you want and come back to me and i will see if its good. sure enough she found the nokia e-5 . she really wanted a fast texting phone fast , so i decided to buy her it . after i ordered she said she was a little iffy and i said we can cancel if we want , but she said it was okay . when the phone came she was still at school so i decided to play around with the phone to test it . it worked very well , fits right in the hand and very fast internet connection and texting . the color is also very nice , it\\'s obviously better than the picture leads you to believe . so my daughter came home , saw the phone , and all she did was use it the whole night . she often talks about how fast everything is and how efficient it is . this phone i definitely good and i recommend to people who like to text a lot.pros: fast texting, good internet speed, nice app storecons: sometimes internet kicks you out, a little hard to find stuff like how to turn your phone on vibrate or silent (but nothing google can\\'t fix), a little confusing the way things are organized but you\\'ll get used to it , texting buttons may be a little smaller for people with big fingers. todo muy bien,perfecto ,era todo como lo esperaba muchas gracias,100% lo mejor ,dios le bendiga......excelente, excelente, agradecido y muy conforme con todo nice phone... the best product is excellent, very fast, only cons is indoor pics are not that clear great price and it does everything i need it to do! phone was horible. buttons didnt work. and it could not be activated. had to return it. do not recommend buying this was quite a good deal and now i have straight talk for less than $45 a month. great phone that helps me save money! its different from the original one this one is thicker and less friendly to use. got this cell phone around december, held up nice. the only criticism i have is that the camera really isn\\'t that great, otherwise.. it does what its supposed to. so far i have had no problems with the phone. it has great reception, i had three bars in the middle of some woods when my friends had none. there was one strange thing that happened and that was a message came up every time it restarted saying launcher3 had crashed but i experienced no issues from this warning. i eventually traced it down to the sd card being slightly off center. the purchase was successful, all very good, i received the product in good condition and functional, everything concrete fast and safely without any mishap. thank you!! very good love it!!! excellent product a very nice smartphone. could not link to my current verizon account, but it does work well with my wi-fi. fast, and light weight. phone is awesome. looks great only small almost unnoticeable scratches by usb port. very very fast phone. i couldn\\'t slow it down playing anything yet. didn\\'t like the way it arrived. the phone was moving in the box because they put the phone box in an envelope with nothing else. other then that i\\'m very satisfied. it works very well i like this cell-phone excellent takes hours to charge (3-5hours). pretty basic phone. not that great. this phone is really good. my wife loves it and with the projectfi integration its really great. just got it.switched from my galaxy note 2...it\\'s smaller but not that much so.the screen is high definition but it\\'s a bit washed out.it charges very quickly but the battery life is not good.gps starts up very quickly for navigation unlock my gsii.the phone is beautiful...very distinct.i don\\'t like how you can see the gridlines of the touchscreen in certain lighting (can\\'t on my gsii).speakerphone for phone calls is not that great; music sounds good but the volume isn\\'t that great.these are my first impressions. i\\'ll update later.***updated***ok - back to amazon my xperia z went. kudos to amazon for having such a wonderfully efficient return/refund process. i returned the phone monday, it arrived at their lexington, ky warehouse tuesday and refund was back in my bank account wednesday. wow.the phone was well made, great materials. but the washed out screen, horrible battery life, and tinny sounding \\'speaker\\' made the phone just not worth it. don\\'t tell me about \\'turn wifi off, turn gps off, turn data off\\'..you may as well just turn the phone off. if you can\\'t use the features of the phone, what\\'s the point?the relief i felt when i switched back to my beautiful and capable galaxy note ii was very surprising. i love my note ii.for the record, i \\'abuse\\' the heck out of my note ii all day long and the battery lasts all day and night. i\\'m very upset! i did not get my otter box case, instead i got a iphone 5 battery replacement with tool kit! i don\\'t even have a iphone 5! i spend almost $30 on a case i did not get!!!!! the phone was received damaged by water, do not check the product before sending it? love the phone. better than my last blu awesome case! my wife loved the colors. she said it has been the best case she has had so far. she has dropped her phone and it hasn\\'t been damaged. love it it\\'s a great little cell phone. my husband has macula degeneration and needed something with larger numbers. this phone serves his purpose. also its easy to use with none of the smart phone things that only confuse older people. would recommend it to anyone who doesn\\'t need to go through labyrinths of information to find what they want. great little phone. we love it. still using it i like the quality of the product and recommend it to my friends excellent product.it is a must to have for travelers.really easy to setup and use. no wifi callingother than that looks good feels good wish it was more popular for more cases and more support from online forums. working fine so far. i find that nokia phones overall provide excellent features. this lumia in particular is very easy to use, has a modern design and, the best, the price is very good. phone is excellent. i made a great choice. it\\'s working great so far. thanks also for the prompt shipping! nice phone, working fine and the dual sim is a plus. good price also for the specs on this phone. i love this phone disappointed (hence the 4 stars) by the fact that a euro plug was sent since i think that an adapter from euro to us should have been included. with that said, the phone so far works well but i cannot say much more as i have not begun to use it extensively. i especially like the use of the pen to take notes, a feature that i look forward to using a lot. incidentally this phone is the replacement for my old trusted nokia e7 which i still use. ordered for a friend and she said best gift received. excelent product as always. the missing star is because when you fix the cover in the back the camera gets covered. very good the product is very excellent love it got it very fast shipping upgraded was a little slow it\\'s finally upgraded to new 6.01,osgot it to work with tradcfone very happy with my new phone excellent service no problemsam a satisfied customer i have poor experience with this phone because it won\\'t charge the battery. i have this same phone but the battery is bad and the pixels are not doing well. have had it for years and really like this phone. the battery from the new phone charged well in the old phone and it worked in the new phone. but if it won\\'t charge in the new phone then there is something wrong with the remanufactacturing process. i bought it and it was dead very dissapionting phone is great works fine my only issue is my charger quit charging after two week. very good, thanks phone is great! it was a huge upgrade for me going from the samsung galaxy s5 to the s7 edge. :) no problems as of yet, phone runs smooth and fast! i love the camera! the seller (wireless everything) was even kind enough to even include a us wall adapter along with the order. very good product this nokia phone is an excellent basic cellphone.stores contacts, big buttons for pressing numbers and uses the symbian os.only problem i\\'ve had with this is the back cover. it is indeed, like other reviewers claim, difficult to open. it requires some force or some fingernails to pry off.you have to be careful not to pry it off the wrong direction incase the clips accidentally break the back cover off.the phone still works without the back cover. (i turned it on after i switched sims just to try it out.)other than that, sound quality of the phone is good. people hear me clearly when i talk to them. it has good loudspeaker, volume can go really high.it\\'s small enough and has a solid feel to it. this is my first smart phone and although i was spoiled with my simple flip phone, i am learning to love the many features. i now take my phone everywhere. excelent.... 04/05/2012 update: i want to do a quick comparison between the nokia c6-00 and android phones, specifically samsung nexus s by google. i\\'ve been using the google android phone for the past 11 months and it did everything i needed it to do from paying for starbucks coffee using a starbucks app so i didn\\'t need to carry my starbucks card around and accessing multiple ms exchange accounts to the interface and os being slick and nimble as well as google directions/mapping/gps; the major downside to smartphones such as android and others is the fact that they are battery drainers because of the intense use of power for the os and display especially. i could not last more than 6-8 hours on android and this is with setting the display to the lowest brightness at all times which is a pain when outdoors in bright sunlight. that was the only issue with my android. anyway, it did everything i needed so i stuck with it. until recently the sounds stopped working. so i sold it and now i am back with nokia. the strength of nokia is the battery lasts a good 14-15 hours on standby (not sure why this amazon description states 16 days or so, no, 15 hours, so at the end of the day before going to bed, you need to charge it up again for the next day). i can only add one ms exchange email account on nokia and i also have gmail installed. the os is not as slick and fast as android and there is a \"white screen\" lag, but you put up with it. the sounds, ringing, call quality and reliability of the nokia as a phone first and foremost is second to none. the android (samsung) had low ringing volume even at maximum. also sprint service for the android was weak in my area, so att under nokia was better. the nokia is a \"workhorse\" of a phone that is loud (volume, i like!) and does a barely ok job at being a \\'smart phone.\\' i will keep using it for now because of long battery life and i can switch out the sim card to my flip phone using the same data plan for traveling using a small flip phone, esp. overseas like europe (att only charges $10 month for unlimited data since it is not considered a smart phone versus minimum $30 for smart phone). will i eventually switch to a smart phone when something i like comes out, yes, of course, the android experience (except for battery life) did everything i needed a smartphone to do (rich apps for banking, starbucks, etc) and my lifestyle. what will i look for in a smart phone next time? strong battery life (easily lasting 15 hours on standby or basically what i call a \\'whole day\\' before charging at night), loud ringer and volume, 4g capability, handle multiple ms exchange email accounts.06/20/2011 update: bought this phone in september 2010. there is still a slight lag (in the form of a \"white screen\") in between applications but other than this and the slight heft (weight) to the phone, it is a good sized pull out keyboard phone. for a while the ovi maps and ovi store apps did not work, i finally figured out i needed to delete the old files from apps manager and redownload ovi maps and ovi store. the trick is it is a catch 22, you cannot download ovi maps with ovi store (the pc sync did not work for me in the first place), and you cannot if ovi store did not work, i finally went to the browser and searched download ovi store and did it that way and once i go ovi store working, downloaded ovi maps and then everything works now. the music was a trick, you need to sync to your pc and copy and paste to the c6 after created a \"music\" folder, then in the c6 press music and then library and then \"options\" and then refresh the list and then your copied and pasted music will show up, otherwise you will be figuring out why it does not show up after a while, you need to manually refresh the music library!i added somore more apps like a flashlight and games, etc. it is 100% working and a nice little phone. however, my main phone is a samsung nexus s 4g from sprint because it is a pure google experience on android, it is faster and smoother, and because i rely on gmail and google calendar and google everything apps, it just works for me. this c6 is a travel phone for me, for example i also have a motorola ming a1200 flip phone i used in europe and the c6 will also be a travel phone for me when i do not need to take my larger nexus s 4g with me traveling. so the c6 is powered off, all set up, and stored away in my closet until my next travel trip (the last time i took it i went to idaho and oregon on business) because the battery life on the c6 lasts a whole day+, the flip phone ming a1200 was even better, a few days battery. the nexus s 4g i charge every night and can\\'t beat the apps and user experience on nexus s.recommendation is 3 stars now from 2 stars. i would recommended it but would advise of the heft and the white screen. everything works on it though, but with ms exchange you can only add one email address so i have a ms exchange address and a gmail address, which is basically what i need for email.11/1/2010 update: had this phone for a few weeks now, the \"white screen\" between switching screens, etc is getting annoying now, for $300+ or so i paid for this phone i expect a faster processor. i am changing my stars from 4 to 2; i would not buy this if i knew how annoyingly this white screen would be.i am reviewing nokia c6 here first since i had time to play with it, i will review the n900 soon in a bit under the n900 product site on amazon (i reviewed the n900 on 10/13/10 so look for it under my \"kingmonkey\" id). the c6 . . . i couldn\\'t decide between nokia n900 and c6 (did not want new n8 coming out end of september 2010 since there was no physical keyboard), so i bought both n900 and c6. phones do not come with a case to hold, which is a disappointment considering how much each phone costs. for some reason nokia only sells oem cases for these phones to the european market, if you go to amazon uk site or nokia eu site you will see cases made for n900 and c6, so i had to go to amazon uk site to order an oem case for n900; the c6 on nokia eu site has some nice ones but could not find them on amazon uk and on nokia eu site i cannot order them online being from the usa as you need to go to a retail location in europe. anyway got some generic case (more like a pouch) for the c6 from amazon uk.the c6 is a nice looking, stylish phone, good size phone, not too thick or long at all, it\\'s fairly small and fits in your shirt pocket if you are a guy. made of quality materials and feels like a quality product from the weight of the phone and also when you slide the keyboard out, it is stiff and not moving about. the top row keyboard key is a little close to the top half of the phone so when you type your thumb hits the top and gets in the way; not a deal breaker for me as i just learn to adapt. those with bigger hands (fingers) may find the keyboard a little cramped but i wanted a smaller smart phone compared to the other ones out there such as samsung galaxy or motorola droid, so it is expected to be smaller overall as that is part of the appeal. physically that was the only issue, again, nokia is stylish, smart looking, and as always, love their nokia ringtone theme. one last thing on the physical side, being a middle of the road phone (between n8 and lower end nokia phones) it doe snot have al of the bells and whistles hence the lower price. one feature i wish it had, like the more higher end n900, is a camera lens cover, the camera is just exposed to dust, etc; the c6 does come with a factory \"screen protector\" and since this is a new phone and you can\\'t buy a screen protector just yet i suggest leaving it on to protect the screen, since after i set up the c6, the screen protector is scratched from my use of the phone (normal use with fingers swiping back and forth, mind you, i take care of my nice things, gently putting it down, wrapping it in napkin until my pouch comes in the mail, wash my hands and dry them, no lotion, before i handled my phone), so even with all of this the screen still gets scratched slightly if you look at it at an angle. anyway will need to buy a screen protector when they are available and hopefully the one that came with it will last.on the software side, the 2gb microsd chip only holds the california map and voice navigation (street names + male voice both for us as two separate files); that\\'s about 2gb total. if you want all of us and other countries, need to buy a 16gb microsd but even with this not sure if it can hold all the maps as you will need to delete some still as some maps are several gigs(i think 16gb additional gigs is the limit the c6 can handle for a microsd card). i don\\'t travel a lot outside of california so it does the job and don\\'t need to buy a bigger sized microsd card for now, i can wait until i need it and by then the microsd card price will go down.the other major issue is i use google calendar, right now you can use ms exchange to set up google mail, calendar and contacts but it imports all of my gmail contacts into my c6 even though i don\\'t actively keep in touch with all of them, i suppose you can choose to update only calendar and gmail and skip the contacts, don\\'t remember if this is an option. the calendar also only updates my main calendar so others i created, including holidays calendars, bill due date calendars, etc do not get imported. this was a deal breaker for me so i deleted this newly created/added gmail account and all of the contacts and email and calendar got deleted, which is what i wanted and it went back to how it was, being empty. by the way when you import this way, any contacts or information you had in the calendar gets overridden with the new import, so my one contact i created with a photo and all got overridden with the import. i had to reenter it. anyway my workaround is to use instead of ms exchange option on nokia to add google accounts like gmail and calendar, etc, i used the \"gmail\" option via the email icon to set up the email account and it works well. as for google calendar, there is a google mobile site and one bookmark webpage you can set up is for google calendar, so for my internet application i set my default homepage as the google calendar address so when i want to look at all (holidays, bills, color coded too) of my google calendars i just open up that bookmarked web page homepage and it is there updated in real time by google. as for the ovi calendar, don\\'t use it, maybe i\\'ll look at it just to see what day it is every sooften. so i get my google calendar but via a webpage site, not the ovi calendar because like i said the ms exchange way to sync gmail mail and calendar and contacts only gives you the main calendar, no other calendars created as discussed above.i also downloaded ovi software to my pc and the linking between the c6 and ovi software on my pc works well, this is how you sync the photos, maps, contacts, etc from your pc to the c6, also faster way to update your c6 with software updates since you download them from the pc first and then link your c6 to the pc via a usb cable and the data transfer is faster. otherwise you would have to do it over airwaves on the c6, which is slower even using 3g but you can connect to wifi if available using the c6.i customized my desktop icons, which is pretty cool, i added a couple rows of frequent contacts, then 3rd row from top gmail, then a couple row of shortcuts below such as web access, a bookmarked web page, calc, camera, last row has messaging icon, then i downloaded an app for messaging, including google talk, from the ovi app store by searching for \"messaging\"--it\\'s called nimbuzz and with this you choose your account type, google talk, yahoo messenger, whatever . . . at first i was lookign and looking for google talk app but it does not exist, you have to access google talk through this 3rd party app nimbuzz or something else equivalent (it was a free app) and it works perfectly fine. the c6 home screen icons,being symbian software based, is a bit \"cartoonish\" when compared to more sophisticated phones like the n900 or droid icons or blackberry 9000 bold, but it\\'s fine and the learning curve is not steep to learn to master the c6 menu and navigation as discussed above.overall i am happy with the nokia, good size, small bar type smart phone, good looking, quality materials. the c6 is symbian based and my n900 is maemo based so another reason i bought both to compare and see how i like them. c6 works with att 3g so since i have an existing att sim card it works great, the n900 i signed up for a t-mobile individual plan text+web+voice and the n900 3g only works with tmobile 3g, so i am set here; if i used the att sim card the att 3g does not work with nokia n900 and would have to settle for edge (non 3g). email me at darian.chin at gmail dot com if you have questions. the headphone jack has started malfuctioning within 3 months of use. it was only 186 when i got it, phone came in a week. it works and looks great, come with a case too they are hard to find. ok good phone. very fast. screen resolution is nice and clear but you can only install few apps from google play store before it starts to give you out of space error. installing a sd card won\\'t help as not every app can be installed on sd card. you can move few of the apps to sd card but partial files still remain on internal storage leaving you very less space for installing others. manual sucks also. most of the stuff you have to figure out by spending time searching online. speaker is not loud enough. the camera of the phone is very good.os is work fast.however, it is not support for lte; it only has 4g very reliable case. my wife loves it and is very durable. it\\'s a great phone, so much bigger and lighter than my girlfriend iphone 5. she\\'s jealous now and wants this phone too. there is no coment i get the right order. it is perfect! need directions first let me say amazon is awesome!! i bought this phone from usa wholesalers. but it was fulfilled by amazon so i got it delivered to me in two days!! the color i got was white and i love it. i was kind of scared because there were so many good reviews on it. so, in the back of my mind i was like this all cant be real. but guys i did my research. i looked up reviews, watched youtube videos and all. after about a week of research i went ahead and bought this phone. i am sooooo happy i did. i took out my sim card from my at&t \"unsmartphone\" and popped it into the star in about a minute it saw that it was an at&t sim and boom!! everything was working!!! and i mean everything so now i have a \"note\"(guys it look just like it and that\\'s what everyone thinks it is) smartphone. all prepaid for 50.00 a month(plus tax depending on where u live). and everyone else i know who wasn\\'t as smart as all of us(that is if you buy the phone) is paying 100.00 or more for a smartphone plan. and under contract, worrying about going over minutes, texts, and data. i don\\'t have to worry about any of that, pay way less than them, and my phone is the coolest ever!!! lol. just a little of what it does:in minutes i downloaded skype, facebook, mp3 music downloaded, about 10 songs. all of it works!when my teenage niece and nephew saw my phone (15 & 16, u know teenagers know about phones) they thought it was a \"note\" and loved the screen and size. while i was visiting they had my phone the entire time. taking pictures with the front and back camera. downloading cool games for me, like fruit ninja(love that geico commercial..lol) and temple run,etc. they didn\\'t want me to go bc they loved my phone..lol(and they both have driod phone by verizon).the only small \"con\" i can say right now is the battery doesn\\'t last as long as a non smartphone. but it does last pretty good taking in consideration i\\'ve been playing with it all day on and off.listening to music, downloading songs, on facebook, texting, making calls,etc. after all that its just a little below half full. i started using it this morning full force so its been about 10hours. so u can be the judge on that. its pretty cool with me. i\\'m going to go buy a car charger so when i use turn-by-turn navigation, i won\\'t have to worry about my battery dying. and it comes with two batteries anyway. so i am good!! so good luck guys i hope my review helps you in your journey for an awesome phone!! do your research, don\\'t rush if you\\'re not sure. but if you\\'re like me after you\\'re research you will be back, and buy this phone!! i don\\'t think you will regret it. i know i am loving it right now!! it\\'s a very good choice!!! happy hunting!!! touch screen died after only 5 months of use excellent phone! maybe i got a defective one, but i just returned this phone because no one could ever understand me when i talked on it. other people sounded very clear, but when i talked, they said it sounded like a foreign language no matter how i held the phone and even after troubleshooting. i will give them one more chance since this doesn\\'t seem to be a common problem. nice to make a purchase from a company who supports our servicemen! the product was easy to fit iphone in. the case seems to fit phone perfectly! so far, it appears to be living up to all that was promise since purchased about 2 months ago. at the same time as protecting my phone, it also is honoring our servicemen! had this phone for a few months and at first it was okay. after a while it started getting slower and slower even when i didn\\'t have many apps installed. the apps also kept force closing themselves especially facebook all the time! however, the camera was great, but i don\\'t think i would recommend this phone. disappointed! no instructions.... purchased it as a present for a teenager, who is very \"tech\" smart and they weren\\'t sure what to do because there wasn\\'t a brand on it to be able to go to a web sight to research. :-( this is an excellent phone. very easy to use. good size screen for texting & calling. just one issue so far as a phone call is terminated. the \\'end call\\' icon moves up the screen too rapidly & the user must scroll down again to find it. i have to check to see if it is a setting issue. would recommend this phone. the pastor will be happy from the gift that we got him! blessings to your company! thanks you very much!regards,emi aguila i purchased this phone and it has not failed me since. i absolutely love it a way better upgrade than my previous phone! i give it a five star because its a great phone for such a cheap price. its has excellent cameras and battery life is very good . i have been using it for almost 2 months now and no problems so far. love it similar to xperia z but i think it is better, but it has good screen gorilla glass protection and scratch very easily. excellent camera especially in low light the samsung j7 is just what i had hoped for. i was looking for a phone with a good camera and sufficient storage. i have downloaded several apps and still have plenty of room for more. so far i am very happy with this phone. it works good for the price you pay. great phone great price! we use htc phones and this is a gift for someone overseas. the price was excellent and the phone arrived in time and in superb condition. i would strongly recommend the seller and would gladly buy from them again. yes, this is what i say about every seller whom i\\'ve bought from through amazon - i\\'ve never had bad service, ever. love this phone! positive:- good condition, no scratches! is like a new in outside.- no software and speed problems, like a new too.- working great on brazilian network, i believe is really worldwide.negative:- the battery is not 100%, i believe that battery is long 20-30% less than original.neutral:- don\\'t came with the earphone and the original box, but is fine to a refurbished one. i bought this phone for my mum. i like it \\'cos its no frills and i expect it will serve her well with basic stuff like make and receive calls. way better than i expected. will be doing more business with letv. wasnt as described they didnt send any charger and it had a cracked case. good cell bought this in december it now will not charge so had to buy another one. this is pretty neat but i have an iphone and the capability is very minimal. only hooks up as a speaker phone or to control music. at the end of the day it\\'s a very cheap good looking watch, intelligent or not. it\\'s comfortable and the band does seem to be a great quality. the phone is good and meets my basic needs. however, the scroll down manual is unclear in many areas. sending and receiving text messages are unclear. have called others who have similar phones for guidance. broken within a week of minimal use. constantly dropped signal. the screen is horrible.returned. (thank you amazon) christopher so far so good. wish i could update the os to the latest android os (lollipop). other than that, ok. less than 2 months and the phone wont charge. it is useless without charging. wish i could give it a negative star rating. love my phone, the only thing battery don\\'t last as long as i thought, i have to full charge it 2xs a day (i think it depends on the use during the day) and other thing to mention screen protectors don\\'t work well on edge they come out quickly when you put the cover. but besides that its a great phone, i compare it to a iphone 6 and this phone haves more features then an iphone 6 camera is way better both video and pictures. works good on our lan and vr box. very happy with the phone. the manual is poorly written. i have had to ask someone to teach me how to use it. it\\'s very nice, is good, but did not come unlocked or with other language options, only english, mandarin and german. the camera is great. it\\'s a bit expensive, is light. this phone cannot be activated because it was not properly cleared before it was sold to me. it arrived on time and i love it maravilloso i was working for few das then i couldn gothru so is no working no more i purchased this phone 8 months ago. i was really excited about receiving a mid-level android phone for so cheap. i used the phone with the stock operating system for 4 months. i hated the phone in the that duration of time. despite the good hardware, the phone was sluggish and froze on me constantly. i felt like i had a legacy android phone. when you have to reboot your phone 4 times a day to keep it running, you know something is wrong. then came the revelation: i wiped the phone of its os/rom and installed a custom rom/os. i put cm9/android 4.0 on the phone. guess what? everything runs phenomenal! my wife has a samsung galaxy s2 and my phone now runs immensely faster than hers. i never experience lag or freezes, the gps works flawless and fast. honestly, i switch between 10 different apps in a matter of minutes and the phone never slows down. it runs extremely fast! i love it so much and it has now become my favorite phone. i\\'m glad i managed to save and salvage it because now it has become the gem i truly wanted. i returned. product was exactly as described this phones battery drains fast no matter how u adjust the screen resolution. the phone gets hot and call quality very poor. would not buy this phone again. i would rate this at about a 10 on a scale of 10. it took me a few days before i figured out that the clr button is the back button for the menu system. knowing that really helps alot. the menus are well layed out and the options very clear. the buttons on the phone seem big enough and are easy to press. the phone seems solid, but light. overall construction seems sturdy. the lcd screens are very clear. i love this phone i got a refurbished when i got it looks like a new onegot it on time thank you thank you such a great phone. got it six months after it came out in 2012 and just upgraded to another phone a few days ago (2016). very solid, and sturdy. i had it in a rubber case that i bought at the 99 cent store and dropped it many times but the screen never cracked. and the home button, power, volume, and vibration switch still work. got lucky i suppose. new updates have made it slow though. i changed the battery myself twice since 2012 and it worked pretty well, lasted me all day sometimes but i only texted and used instagram/facebook/web, i didn\\'t game. since then i bought three of the same for my family as well. people made fun of me for having such an old, small screen, fat, phone compared to their iphone 6s, etc. but it still works just fine. i\\'ll miss you my sweet, fat, slow prince. blackberry curve 3g 9330 phone, gray (verizon wireless)adquiri 2 telefono de estos y ha sido imposible usarlos en venezuela, por favor que posibilidad hay de cambiarlos, lo acabo de recibir el dia 26 de noviembre de 2011. indicar direccion donde puedo devolverlos y a nombre de quien por favor phone looks new. the price was great and i would definitely buy from jemjem again this is an amazing phone! i purchased this to replace my blackberry 9700 because it was starting to act crazy. it got to the point where the phone would freeze when a call came through only to unfreeze when the caller hung up. finally fed up i chose to get this device. originally i was not interested in this phone because i was still scarred from the g1 experience and wanted nothing more to do with android. after my friends found out i was intensely looking into the htc hd7 they worked diligently to change my mind and steer me back to android. this smartphone does everything and more. i will be as detailed as possible about this device.packagingwhen i received the package i found that it was very well put together. the box, of course, was open because the dealer needed to remove the sim card and to unlock the phone. otherwise the phone was pristine and looked like i had ordered it from tmobile. the items that were included was the phone, travel charger extender, data wire, battery, 16 gb micro sd card, samsung premium in-ear earphones, and the manuals. one thing i did not like about the charger was that there is not a wire attached to the travel portion so you have to always use the data cable to charge the phone. this looks like it\\'s the norm for this line of phones, so no quality loss on behalf of the dealer, just simply samsung\\'s poor designing. the back of the phone is a little flimsier than i would like, but that\\'s all opinion. the weight of the phone is not heavy at all but is so sturdy that one would think that a metal back would make it a little classier. i have the samsung behold as well, much cheaper than this phone, and it has a really nice metal-like back on it. overall, however, the packaging was very professional.screenthe screen on the phone is a four inch super amoled screen. the colors are very vibrant and crisp with no visible pixelation.networki have tmobile unlimited prepaid service, which is $70 a month. i had absolutely no issues in getting service started. i live in an area where my blackberry constantly stayed between edge and 3g, never fully 3g service so i had no high hopes for this device. however, i was pleasantly surprised when i installed my sim that the indicator was telling me that i was on the 4g network. i have been on this network all day and it has not dropped bars and has remained a steady 4g so i am thrilled about that. the hspa+ service definitely works and the connections are extremely fast. no issues in that department.email setupi had a little difficulty setting up my email addresses on the phone. i tried fruitlessly when i first turned the phone on to activate my yahoo accounts and the server kept stating that it was not available and could not process my request. i gave up for a few hours and tried again and it did connect. if email is important to you, it may be a slight headache to activate but will run smoothly when it\\'s actually configured. i found that i needed to set up a gmail account in order to use the marketplace. while it is not necessary to have a gmail account to access the os upon first turning the phone on (like the g1), you should take into account that to use this feature you will have to create an account. i still have not synced my student email to the phone because it\\'s asking for features i do not have (domain). in comparison the blackberry 9700 allowed me to sync my school account with no issues and never asked for a domain. i just input the email address and password and off i went. this is a slight annoyance but not the end of the world.messagingmessaging is pretty standard here. the setup and the color scheme makes it enticing to look at and operates beautifully. there are two keyboards on the phone: swype and samsung. i am not much on swyping because i kept making mistakes and that is slightly agitating. i changed the keyboard to samsung standard and my headache of texting went away!call leveli found that there were no issues on the calls that i placed. i heard no static, the calls didn\\'t drop and that\\'s all one could ask for. this phone does support wifi calls. i made a few calls on wifi and also found no issues in the quality.bluetoothit took me less than a minute to sync my bluetooth with this phone. the phone found the device in about five seconds, found the password ota and entered it for me and then connected. i was shocked at how fast and effortless it was.browserthe internet browser is really decent. i was able to go to every site that i attempted with no issues. this phone has adobe flash embedded in the browser so therefore you are able to view video\\'s within various websites without the video\\'s being attached to youtube which is really nice.battery lifethe battery life on this phone is excellent, as far as i can tell. i charged the phone completely when i received it without turning it on to ensure that i did not destroy my battery power before i even got started. i don\\'t know if that\\'s a myth, but i charged first just in case it wasn\\'t.overall this is a nice device and definitely worth the amount of money it\\'s listed for. i have been looking at and reviewing the specs for weeks now and i am glad that i made this choice. i would recommend this to anyone on the tmobile network but i cannot definitively say that this works on other gsm carriers because i was not able to test other carriers. minus the battery charger, the back cover, and email issues i give this device a 4.5/5.0!**edit june 27, 2011**this phone has a really nice, crisp, vibrant display but one problem i have found is when sitting outside in the sunlight you almost cannot see what\\'s on the screen. for this inconvenience i am dropping this review down to a 4.0. what is the point of having a mobile device if you cannot see the screen outside which is the primary purpose of a portable phone?another issue i have stumbled on is that the ringtone does not always ring. there are times when i have notifications when i turn the screen on but i did not hear the tone go off. for this to be fixed you have to turn the phone off and back on. i don\\'t know if that was just my device but that has annoyed me a little. the ringtones are also a little lower than i would like.i have been enjoying this device, but there are some issues one cannot overlook just because i like the phone. i still recommend it however if these issues are enough to agitate you then i would find something else.**edit june 29, 2011**i never reviewed the video and music player because i had not tried them at the time of the original review. i typically don\\'t use my phone other than for what it\\'s intended for because i have a zune hd which is music and video ad i like to keep media seperate from my phone because of the battery power usage however i wanted to see what else this phone could do. i have .avi movies on my computer so i decided to sync some to the phone to see what the quality really looked like. i was blown away at how crisp the screen was! when listening to the movies through earphones you have the ability to listen in 5.1 surround sound and it sounds like you are in the movie theater. i really enjoyed this feature. the mp3 player was delightful as well. i listened to an entire 12 song album and viewed a 1 hour 50 minute movie on this phone without being plugged to the charger and my battery never dropped power bars. i am thrilled with the battery life in this respect and that the media on the phone does not drain it. very nice experience!**edit july 5, 2011**i took a mini trip for the 4th of july to an area in my state that normally has decent coverage on t-mobile\\'s network. i ran into a lot of problems with this phone when i got into this area because the phone is provisioned for hspa+ and this area is edge/3g, more edge than 3g. when i tried to use my phone i continuously got dropped calls or my calls would not complete and i am not going to get started on the net service out there. because of the phone constantly looking for a 4g connection it sucked my battery down rather quickly and my phone just wasn\\'t working. i am glad that this was just a getaway and not where i live, however, it is imperative that if you are considering this phone that you go to [...]and check the coverage very carefully because if you are not in a 4g area there is a great chance that you will assume that the phone bites when in actuality it\\'s the coverage, not the phone. i am not too sure about the at&t customers and how they may fare with this issue because i do not have an at&t sim, but i would send my advice their way also. check the coverage at at&t if you have that service because your sim will be hitting their cell sites.**edit july 9, 2011** wireless tetheringi know this is a lot of updates, but i am still finding new options on this phone. so, i was in the android marketplace wanting to find a tethering service for this phone because my blackberry 9700 had a tethering service named tether and it was great and useful while i was at work. i found the same app in the marketplace and attempted to download it. much to my annoyance and dismay it was not easy to set up. i had to download something called samsung new pc suite which allowed you to install the device on the computer and sync music and video\\'s to the phone. while playing around with my settings i found that i was able to plug my phone into the computer with the pc suite, activate tethering on the phone, and connect to the internet! i was not on my wifi at the time and i was confused because my pages were still loading on my computer. i did not have to download any 3rd party tethering program (and pay for it) because this phone has a built in tethering program and no, i did not have to pay extra for that feature on the phone. here are the steps to activating the wireless feature:1. download samsung new pc suite (preferrably an updated version) and install the program.2. plug the phone into the computer and wait for the drivers to install, in which case you should receive the popup in the bottom right tray that says that everything installed and you should be able to use the phone.3. on your phone, hit the backspace key if you have a screen giving you three options which are for the kies firmware update, mass storage, etc. after you hit the backspace key you should be back to the main screen on your phone.4. hit \"applications\" and scroll over to \"settings\". click on \"settings\".5. tap \"wireless and network\", then tap \"tethering\".6. you should have a \"usb tethering\" option. tap this option so that a checkmark is in the box. in your task bar at the top of the phone, you should see tethering enabled. you can hit the house to go back to the main screen on the phone.7. if your computer is windows 7 and configured like mines you should see a little mini computer in the task bar next to the time. this will tell you that the connection is active. if it has a yellow bar next to it give it a few moments to connect to the internet. at this point you can surf the web! no extra money to put out, no gimmick, just internet.i am super glad that i was able to figure this out because i downloaded a trial and did not pay for the app but once i figured out how to get the app installed on the computer i was going to pay for the full app which was, like, $32 dollars. that\\'s a lot to pay for a feature you already have for free, in my opinion. if you run into any issues trying to install this then there are support forums that will walk you through the issues. i cannot say that this is the same process on vista or before because all of my pc\\'s have been updated to 7. as far as at&t i cannot say if they allow this connection because i also have no at&t access but it is definitely worth a try. i think that this is a great feature and i thank samsung for caring enough to add this, and for tmobile not blocking my connection, because it\\'s a lifesaver when not around a connection or a hotspot but have school work or something that must get done.**edit july 24, 2011** seidio innocell 3000 mah batteryon the 1620 mah battery that comes with the phone i was ultimately able to squeeze out 11 hours of usage, from 9:45 a.m to 8:00 p.m, on heavy use. the problem i ran into was that i actually leave my job at 10 p.m, sometimes a smidgen later, and i was not thrilled with having a dead phone to go home with. with that, i chose to get the seidio innocell 3000 mah battery from amazon. i received this battery on friday afternoon. charged it from 7:30 p.m to 2:00 a.m saturday morning. i used this phone from 2:00 a.m until 4:00 a.m sunday and my phone was still at 4%. this is after over 3 hours of conversation, non-stop messaging, facebook messages and status updates, internet, youtube video\\'s for 30 minutes, gaming and using the oi shopping app when i got off work at midnight and picked up a few things for sunday dinner at wal-mart. calculate the time: from 2:00 a.m saturday til 4:00 a.m sunday i did not touch my charger. i took my charger to work with me just in case and never pulled it out of my purse. that is 26 straight hours of power, and then some because when i went to bed at 4 a.m my phone was at 4% and i could not kill the battery and trust me i did everything i could to kill it because i am still conditioning the battery and wanted to charge it from slam dead. however, i gave in and charged it at 4%. there is no telling how long that battery truly lasts beyond 4% because i had to give up and go to bed and i needed a working phone later in the day and did not want to chance standby and a dead phone when i woke up 8 hours later. nonetheless, this is an accessory that is really necessary if you are like me and enjoy having the phone all day! this battery is $56.00 here on amazon.com and it\\'s worth every penny! (i did a more detailed review on the battery page and like the phone journey i will be updating that review as i get more of an understanding of what it will be doing over time, especially next weekend when i am done conditioning it.)**edit august 14, 2011**less than 2 months after getting this phone it has begun to freeze on me and shut off in the middle of the calls. the dialer is forcing close as well. this was my main issue with the g1 when i had it a few years ago. it forced closed so many times that i was forced to get another phone. i have not found the reason for the freezing and shut off but it has disconnected my calls at least three times this week and re-booted as well as the calls will mysteriously drop with full signal. i am not going to throw in the towel just yet. i will do a little googling and see if maybe this phone is due for an update but if this issue is not fixed soon i will be forced to get another device, which i really do not want to do at this point. for these new issues, i am going to drop this to a three star rating and raise it back to four if i can fix it.**edit auguest 17, 2011** roots and mobile access points, oh my!okay, a few days ago i have been having issues with my phone cutting off in the middle of conversations and dropping calls on full 4g signal strength. i went through my settings and realized that i was a \"super user\". now, i know that having a \"rooted\" phone does not mean that it will cause the phone to power cycle or drop connection, however, ever since i \"unrooted\" this device i have not had any additional issues with it powering off or dropping calls. for those who don\\'t understand what rooting is, this is a process very similar to taking over administrative rights to your computer, only it\\'s taking over ownership of your phone which allows you to download and install third party applications. the phones from this dealer are rooted and unlocked, so that\\'s something to consider if you start having issues similar to what i experienced.i also just found out that this phone is a wireless access point, which allows you to wirelessly share your data connection through the phone company with up to five additional wireless devices. i tried this last night with my zune hd and my laptop and it works beautifully. to enable this feature:1. go to settings2. go to wireless and network3. go to mobile ap (3rd option)4. select mobile ap (1st option; option will not be active if battery dips below a certain point)5. activate wifi on the device you want to use and look for the network, usually named \"android\" with some numbers after the name.i cannot definitively say that this actually work for carriers other than tmobile, because i have no other sim cards to test, but it\\'s always worth a shot! remember that mobile ap is a hotspot but that it also uses your data so make sure you have unlimited if you plan on using this option a lot. tmobile has no more than 5gb of data, which is rumored to be unlimited but i don\\'t know because i am somewhat midway through the month and i have used over 2gb of data, so we will see at the end of the month if it is, indeed, unlimited. excellent seller recommend keyboard letters too small. not a good phone excellent arrived, only one critical to the company blu, the terminal is a little heavy for my taste, but no complaints for amazon since the package arrived excellent if you\\'re like me and use your smartphone to make calls, text, internet/e-mail ... this phone is perfect! it does not handle advanced games as well as a $700 phone but it runs simple games like boom beach easily. camera does not compare to my wife\\'s htc m9 but again this is 1/6th of the price. speaking of price, the phone is cheap enough that you don\\'t really need a case for it... i\\'ve dropped mine more times than i can count and so far no damage; if it does break...i\\'ll just buy another one :-p it is not the international version. don\\'t buy it great product! love amazon! 👌 enjoy all the features. fast,easy switch from my lg g2... nice phone its a great phone, for calling, texting, pictures and use a few apps. now, the screen size is a plus, very clear but some times get unresponsive, the speakers for talking are great but to listen music not that great. and the reason i give a 3 stars is the battery, very poor performance, the meter tells you: you have one day of power and in reality last around 3+ hours. for me its a great phone but the battery bad performance over lap the other great features of the phone. if you are into internet, videos, games and music i wont recommend it for the lack of power in battery, if only use for calling, texting, taking pictures in other words, just the basic. then its ok for you. pros: usibility, battery life, reliability, nice screan, performance.cons: touch screen screan is not responsive during charging. phone does not work, it turns off by itself and does not hold charge. great protection from careless handling. easy install. looks great. great good quality excelente nice but couldnt fiqure out how to work it so i sent it back be gusto mucho i was skeptical about buying a used phone online. the last company sent me an iphone 4 instead of a 4s. so i checked out this company and decided to get the iphone 5c. the price was the best online. i\\'ve had it for a few months and it works great. it looked brand new. i came very fast. it had a clean esn and was easy to connect to att. i love this phone. i now trust this company and will re-order again if i upgrade to another phone or electronic. thank-you very much. so many in depth reviews saying almost everything i wanted to say...this phone is really awesome! i am not a motorola fanboy, actually it\\'s my 1st moto phone ever, but couldn\\'t resist buying it.only few points i will emphasize on:-the look: many reviewers kept on comparing this phone with other phones-specs wise, forgetting to put into consideration the size factor! i never had or wanted to have any phone bigger than 3.2\" till i saw the beauty of this razr ( & to be honest the gs2 in regard of being slim as well). the phone is a certain conversation starter, looks really cool, well built and definitely not cheap ( and it isn\\'t!)the very new htc one is bragging to be one of the slimmest phones, well, as slim as it is, it is still bigger than the razr!have been checking most of the phones that are appearing in the market and none could beat the beauty of the razr imo.-the speed: added tons of apps and games, no sweat!-battery: dunno what other reviewers expected from a phone with such a processor, screen & 4g but this needs power! my last 4 smartphones\\' batteries (in 5 years) couldn\\'t last more than a day, so this one is no surprise. add juice defender app and it helps u go through the day with moderate use. some days i talk too much and play too much this is when i need to charge it twice a day, i have a portable external battery that i got off e-bay for around $10. it works fine and is really small.easier to carry even in pocket.despite that i actually took one star off cos of the battery and lame camera..at this price range i still expected more from the battery and definitely a more stable cam. u do get better shots when u get to know how to use it, but it could definitely have been better.overall the best smartphone imo now in market, and will get better with the ics upgrade in few months. white chips easily. works well, looks like hell. very good image great phone, good price. worked great for 4 months, then it stopped. the phone will not charge, the power button no longer works, and it does not receive touch input. all in all a waste of $ 275. it\\'s definitely worthy, works like new and the item is in a very good condition!!! definitely recommended!!! there is a system glitch in the e550a. the company gives you long instructions to fix it but if your not a \"techy\" it\\'s a pain.. unlocked cell phone kings.remember the name of this company when you buy a phone.i thought i bought a blackberry at a good price because it is an older version.i bought and kept it in storage and i gave it to the person 3 days ago.boy,this phone is a toy phone.nothing works and everything is plastic.please e-mail at charlessquare@hotmail.com for further details.i contacted the company and see what happens. excellent power button would not work the way it should thanks! excellent! i love it specially because you can send it to mexico and it works, just you have to put in the sim card and that\\'s it, you don\\'t have to do nothin else. i have only been using the phone for 4 months (since it was a christmas present) and the camera no longer works. it all started with just the front one but now not even the back one works. in addition to this problem the phone starts a weird vibration every time i open an app that requires camera usage (facebook, instagram, snapchat, etc) and it shuts down, the phone turns off. the company should be responsible for this problem. i do not want a refund i want a cellphone that works! the touchscreen did not work at all when i first got the phone. the screen did work for a short time before malfunctioning again. the supplier is sending me a new phone so maybe this one will actually work. it\\'s great except the head phone thing is broke 😔😔 the phone is really good and it\\'s really cool but if you have it in your back pocket and you sit on it the screen will crack. and the phone is not sturdy at all but the rest is good same thing i like the blu phone but everyone of them have space issue .. nice phone didn\\'t work with verizon sim card as it advertised it would it`s a great phone, very confortable, two line in one movil with android system!!! this phone is everything i wanted and best of all it worked right out of the package for phone calls. i had to call bmobile in trinidad and tobago to upgrade to 4g data for my data to work as my old phone was a blackberry and we have different data plans for them here. samsung has made me an android convert :)the blue is lovely, i\\'ve only seen it in white here in trinidad.for those who are on digicel and complained that the data was locked, call digicel and upgrade to 4g. this is truly an unlocked phone there is some crutch on the front of the phone . but its work good and i will keep it phone was purchased for a consumer cellular contract. delivery and price were excellent, and the phone works fine. product exactly as described with prompt service. i loved every single feature this phone had to offer... the only problem was that highly talked about \"mobile carrier\" problem. i had this phone for about a month & the problem of \"dropping signals\" persisted consistently throughout this period with me having no solution that would not void the possibility of returning this product.my mobile carrier was continuously dropping for no apparent reason (obv. antennae problem). other than that the phone was absolutely amazing.but with that being said... obviously without the ability to make/receive phone calls, this phone was rendered almost completely useless when i was in dire need. clock not working all the time... very good. ok ok there are some scratches on screen and the phone\\'s back. i do not think it\\'s new at all. fantastic phone all around great specs for the price very nice budget phone. i bought this on the amazon warehouse deals, the phone came in excellent condition. the phone itself it\\'s good, however asus would not release a android 6 update for the os. zen apps including the uis are better than expected, i was going to revert to stock android but so far it has be working great. i recommend this phone but at a reasonable price. i paid 150 usd due to its almost as new condition, definitely happy! i buy the product because i saw that the date of arrival was 6 the same day of my trip but it turns out that the package arrived and thought i should complete that not that good. the product is delivering at 8 front the apartment office but the office is closed 6 pm is crazy excelente!!! good product, although i had a little issue because of the wifi..... but overall was a good expirience greetings from veneuela not even worked one year, which i got for my son, with so much promise, he is so sad just in one year phone is dead, what sort product you people sell, never buy from you again excelente this is not what i thought this phone was like. i am sending it back for refund. i don\\'t really meet my expectation. works perfect, just as advertised. it was in pristine condition and packaged very nicely. wonderful transaction and phone...thank you! fantastic seller, smoking fast shipping. i wish everyone did business this way!! this may not be the \"best\" apple phone but it is amazing. i still like microsoft based phones and there are pros and cons to both. completely dissatisfied. unusable phone, attempted to return, have yet to receive a refund. muy bueno,lo recomiendo,este aparato es muy bueno,hay que leer bien las instrucciones para conocer bien os detalles y y disfrutarlo a cabalidad good for some one doesn\\'t want internet and easy to use phone ... don expect any thing fancy .. good phone i got this phone after i had iphone 4 for 4.5 years, so the lg is miles away in any parameter.love it!! after the camera broke, i decided to upgraded my samsung s3 i had for 3 years, to this samsung galaxy s5...and i love it!love the camera... very clear and professionalsound is great and the screen res is amazing...and i have been known to drop my phone often... amd sometimes where the moisture content is higher that of the typical tolerance for machanical devices....thank you water resistance... now i don\\'t have to worry about that... (accidentally tested that feature) bought this for my daughter, but she did not like it, and it does not appear to function like other smart watches do, so it was returned. it was supposed to be a verizon compatible phone but it was a sprint phone. very good i ordered this cell phone with the understanding that it was an unlocked us version nokia 2730 flip phone. what i received was a locked flip phone that was shipped from singapore. i spent 8 hours at two different at&t stores trying to get this phone to work....they even replaced my sim card twice while i was at the store...but to no avail...the phone would not work. i contacted amazon, and they contacted the seller. i returned the phone for a refund but the clincher is the returned phone had to be sent to israel which makes me a little uncomfortable since the phone came from one foreign country and had to be returned to another foreign country. amazon has assured me i will get my money back.....but i guess i will just have to wait and see. the seller did offer to exchange the phone once they received the one being returned....needless to say i was a bit skeptical of this....i feel like the whole thing was a bait and switch. amazon has been very helpful in this matter....i shall wait for my refund......we will see. it was excellent. thank you. i\\'ve owned 4 other blu phones and they were great but this one is by far the best that blu has ever come out with. one suggestion to blu is they need to make it like past blu phones that allowed you to move apps over to the sd card to free up space and should have included a flash for the selfie camera ( i did find an app for that though) . otherwise great product. i probably won\\'t have to buy another blu for a few years. they have a few glitches with restarting itself occasionally but overall the best phone i\\'ve owned. update: 11/18/16. it is now stuck on lg logo screen. i called lg and no warranty since it is international version. don\\'t buy international version otherwise even if it is manufacturers defect, it is not covered!$400 range, i chose this phone. what made the decision for me is the camera. very im6pressive camera with manual control which means you can shoot like dslr. the other options were the nexus 6 or moto x pure. i like a lot!! excelente i bought it for a gift. i turned it on and seems to work great. i bought this as a gift using the virgin no contact plan. the only negative i have is not with the phone but with the plan as web usuage is based on having a wi-fi connection which isn\\'t always accessible. plus the one i was giving this too does not have internest service at her home, so had to use a neighbor\\'s password to connect to the web. not real handy. not an original product. its a knock off. i got another phone just like this one at verizon store and realized the difference right away. it feels different this phone bends and cracks much more, and has minor visual differences. the biggest give away is that i noticed that there was a gap at the top of the phone and i could easily slide mi finger nail inside and lift up the screen.... wonderful phone. have never had a phone that had this many bars this often. catching calls now that i would of missed with my samsung note 3 or 4. where the notes had 1bar, the blu has 3. i have tested this with both samsung notes and a $140. blu and this blu. blu is the winner. blu has one powerful radio.all the extra stuff you get in the box means you\\'ll not have to buy anything extra except a sdcard.the phone does not have all those extra installed apps on it that you can\\'t remove.the phone moves as fast if not faster than the notes.i have been a samsung man for a long time, but now i have switched.the only thing that is less on this phone is the price tag! nice phone, works perfect in south america. i bought this for my dad and he\\'s been using it for 5 days now, and he loves it! i mostly chose it for the battery life since he always complained about with his last phone. i used it for a short time to test the performance and needless to say, it\\'s zippy. no way as fast as my g4, but it gets the job done. i might even get one for when i go camping or for work. dual sim is very handy. my dad and i would recommend! amazing phone, a compact size, very easy to use, very fast, with many practical functions, i recommend it 100%, everything is very high quality i was cautious about ordering a phone from a second party like this, but i was very pleasantly surprised at the service and the quality of the phone. the phone is very nice. there are no scratches anywhere. it works perfectly. i was also contacted by the company about a week after i received the phone just to be sure that it was received fine. they were very professional. i have recommended them to my friends. works great i got the phone blocked and now i have to pay $50 to unlock it. it glides on almost every surface...one day i was laying down on concrete floor and my phone slid off my pocket and fell about 3-4 inches before it hit the ground and cracked the screen. be warned, it will slide off of metal, wood and plastic and will brake easily. i love it was perfect when it arrived i had a iphone 4 this 5s is great very happy. it arrived on time. would recommend this seller. awful, don\\'t waste your time or money on this works perfectly. i am very satisfied with the delivery and the quality of the product. i wished there was a phone # i could call to speed up communication once i received the blackberry. as i had rather do personal research rather than go back-and-forth with e-mails to figure out some of the per-existing setup on that phone.but on the over-all i am very happy with this purchase. great phone very good! works great!! this is a fantastic phone. good value for the price, works fantastic in every way, and the best thing is that it is not insanely expensive. if you spend two or three times as much, or more, you get very little in return for the difference in price. for those that are wondering, this is plug-and-play for cricket customers. i took the sim card from my low buck nokia 635, stuck it in the sim slot, and bam... everything worked flawlessly. only thing i lost in the process was old text messages.a couple of side notes to bear in mind as you are shopping. get a good case and a tempered glass screen protector. i like the case i bought for it too. should provide good protection, but not too bulky and without the sticky rubber than turns your pockets inside-out. the tempered glass covers are much better than the cheap plastic film that your fingers stick to and are prone to bubbles. below are links to the accessories i purchased... very happy with those also.evocel® lg g vista [dual layer series] hybrid armor protective case for lg g vista (verizon/at&t) - retail packaging, slate (evo-lggvista-sa01)lg g vista glass screen protector, dmax armor® lg g vista screen protector [tempered glass] ballistics glass, 99% touch-screen accurate, anti-scratch, anti-fingerprint, bubble free, round edge [0.3mm] ultra-clear, maximum screen protection from bumps, drops, scrapes, and marks [1 pack]- retail packaging i really liked the case. fits my phone like a glove. the price was great for an otterbox. looks great on my phone. but the problem i\\'m having is i\\'ve had it on my phone less than 2wks & the hot pink gets stained from my jeans or anything it comes in contact with. i\\'m not a dirty person so i\\'m not doing anything special for the pretty hot pink to start darkening. i think it\\'ll only be a matter of time before i have to replace this b/c it looks like crap from the discoloration. if it wasn\\'t for that i\\'d give it 5 stars. but i see myself replacing it soon. i\\'m constantly wiping it off but it doesn\\'t all come off. ugh :( good i have used other phones i think i am super unlucky or its the company on my 6 different blu phone and i have had a new issue with each. my husband owns the blu 6.0 hd and loves it... i just ordered my last try with this company cross your fingers.one i had screen issue one i had a bluetooth/wifi issue... one dropped calls.... one doesn\\'t have service 1/2 the time and i can not send photos. each phone in the first 30 days has failed :( received phone in a speedy fashion and am very happy that i got this phone. works great. we previously reviewed this purchase as 5 stars with usale100. we were wrong. the phone was advertised as \"new and sealed.\" when we attempted to register the warranty on this \"new\" phone, we discovered that the phone\\'s warranty expired already because the phone has been registered and used by another person 2 years ago. this phone is neither new nor certified as refurbished. it also looked like it may have been tampered with. buyer beware!!!!!!!! i am having problems to get some services on my phone from tstt in trinidad & tobago, i need information for apn settings thxs phone came with screen popped out, but still working, and a scratch on the back. a day later, the phone screen was completely popped out. sending it back as soon as possible. the phone does not works. it\\'s defective or locked. the phone doesn\\'t recognize networks. the box o received was opened. review for blu life 8. i am having trouble with this phone. i have given it almost 30 days and no improvement. the touchscreen is unresponsive on the right edge most of the time. i have to rotate the phone to use the keyboard. the back button at the bottom of the phone does not respond most of the time which there is nothing i can do but close app. and restart. sometimes the phone closes apps. on its own for no reason. the phone vibrates for no apparent reason. if these bugs did not exist the phone would be great. i was not satisfied at all the phone wouldn\\'t let me download most apps from the play store and youtube wouldn\\'t play worke fine with all local operators (i live in guatemala, central america). digital services are fully operative. do not try to navigate. the browser is useless. bluetooth connectivity works great with earpiece. camera is just for fun. i recommend it as a secondary phone. this phone is a beast. love it. great phone for it\\'s price the best phone, 100% recomended phone serves my purpose. still have not been able to open pictures sent to me , will not download. instruction booklet was not helpful. i was very surprised to note that this phone\\'s internal storage is only 197 mb which is very low storage space and also there is not enough appson this and i can\\'t download anything because there in not enough storage space. my friend told me he brought a samsung galaxy exhibitand the internal storage is about 1.37 gb, what a difference and he paid $54 for that phone. i am very upset about this purchase becausei reccomend my friend andres solis to purchase this. love it i decided i wanted an unllocked phone and after lot\\'s of searching found blu. i started out with the blu studio 5.0c phone but it was having reception issues and i was not really in love with the feel of the phone. after much debate after returning the phone i decided to give blu one more shot. so after more research i settled on the blu life one in white. i got the phone last week and had it all set up within ten minutes with my att sim card i had from the first blue phone i purchased. it looks and feels great and the reception has no issues on this device. i have to say the extra $50 dollars this phone cost really makes a difference in feel and quality, well worth it. the case for the white phone comes in a greyish black color that looks nice and the screen protector went on easy (i use scotch tape while installing it to help get the lint off screen before placing plastic). when i have moderate to heavy use i do need to charge at the end of the day but if not it stays charged longer.so all in all if you are looking for a phone that looks great feels great works great and is under $200 oh ya and is unlocked i would say to give this option a try! this phone does most of what it is supposed to, but there is at least one time each day when i can only get it to start up by removing the battery or doing that 20-second thing with the vol - and on key. if it weren\\'t for that, i would be pretty happy with it. battery could be better, and it seems to hold a high charge for a long time and then drop precipitously. keyboard seems to be set for typing below the letter. the phone is exactly what it was advertised to be. i have been using it since august, and it is wonderful! delivered in excellent condition. i would buy from jp mobiles again without hesitation. i like so much i had this phone for 2 days and it\\'s is a horrible phone. all it does is freeze and runs very slow with apps and the battery life is only like 5 hours good sale perfect!! recomendados! really good phone.. really good phone for making call and sending sms.if expect more just buy android. love the phone received it on may 16th and now it will not charge unless the charging cord is rigged in some kind of way and i know it\\'s the charging port bc i have tried 7 different charging cords and 4 different charger wall plugs. and since friday has been shutting itself off and on several times throughout the day. so aggravating i bought this phone 2 months after having bought blu life one for the first time and the screen shattered completely so i\\'ve bought 2 phones in the past 6 months. good job.! excelente very great product. was very nervous about ordering but it was perfect unlocked and didn\\'t look used at all. i ordered it on the 14th and got it to days later. very fast shipping and no hasel at all. could not receive text messages. at & t store could not get phone to receive as it was unlocked and what they called a \"foreign\" phone (doesn\\'t seem to be compatiable). i am trying to get approval for a return, so far, have not been able to return it. !!!!!!!!!!!!!!! highly disappointed !!!! will not purchase from this seller again! excellent sold me a stolen/reported iphone. being honest gets you paid, not taking people\\'s money and phones. amazing phone, very fast, excellent pictures, hd screen very bright, 5*. excellent deal, got exactly what was advertised in like new condition. 100% positive experience, thank you. love this phone even with the wp8.1 update i don\\'t have some of the issues others had. my only complaint is the weight of the phone. a lot of apps didn\\'t work , phone was slow in responding. couldn\\'t screen shot. excellent very good product nice price great product the home key is not work!!the home key is not work!!the home key is not work!!how can i do? good and cheap choice! how to see the keypad especially if i call toll free # and they asked me to press #.i did\\'nt see the keypad show in the screen.somebody can help me pls? this phone hasnt been working properly from i got it, and now it does work at all...i have taken it to several shops and no one seems to be able to help. worst by ever!!! if i could rate 0 stars, i would\\'ve!!!i thought i bought this item from bestseller2013, instead what i recieved was a f7100 (which is just as big and thrice as useless). once i recieved the product, i emailed the buyer to get an exchange and was told this is what was advertised!!! o.....k, lets start with the specs on the f7100-3mp back camera, vga front camera, 1.0 dual core cpu, cheap plastic feel, weak flash, bad screen resolution that looked like ever photo was shot from the fog yonder. i didnt need to see more and sent the manufacturers back their phone. the problem was i had to get amazon involved with their a-z gaurantee or bestseller2013 would\\'ve stuck me with crap!!! after the shipping and handling for this package back to china (which was another 25+ hard earned dollars) i now have to wait 20+ days for them to check for \"extrinsic damage\" and refund my money...all in all a little under $200.00 dollars thrown down the drain and i\\'m hoping amazon will continue their good cutomer service and help me with the remainder of the situation. in conclusion, if you want the original android, cheap and useless camera, and a phone that will always remind you of a t-mobile prism wrapped in a huge shiny cheap feeling wrap, order this, if not, get a real phone from amazon and save yourself weeks of a headache (because bestseller will ensure that) buenos días, compre un equipo con el cual no estoy nada satisfecho por que a pesar de que decía que era nuevo el equipo vino con muchas fallas entre las que menciono: la carcasa me vino partida, las conexiones de wifi y de bluetooth no funcionan, a las dos semana de haberlo puesto en funcionamiento se le borro el software y se le coloco nuevamente, hace poco la pantalla se puso totalmente en blanco, para ser un equipo \"nuevo\" tiene demasiadas fallas very good phone but the seller office equipment in a box from another phone that was not the original motorola, this gives a lot to think for that reason he would not make another purchase i got this phone about 2 months ago and i love it it has good battery life and good and clear calls i love this phone i would get another and the price was good satisfactory i am almost speechless about this phone. it is frigin awesome !!!! good product. used it oversea (togo). works fine but has reception issue. the reception is very week. no connection in rural area compare to my brother\\'s cheap basic phone. lol lower rating now, almost one year later. i can not be 4ft away from my phone, it loses connection. it randomly loses connection also. this is happening after i take extreme care of the watch. battery life is still decent though. i could only image how it will hold up doing activities. started great but now dying slowly. on the product specs state work with gsm 850 mhz and 1800 mhz which is not true, the factory spec (which i found later) state work with 900mhz, 1900mhz and 2100mhz only,so unable to use it as a phone, misguided info_. on america only work within a few countries_. please do yourself a favor. do not buy this phone. the duos. the camera stopped working within two months of use. i reset the phone. called samsung customer service, nothing could be done. the worse thing is i purchased two phone. the camera quality is not good. good love it very nice phone, bought it as a gift for my sister..she loves it all i have to say is. wow! the battery last all day for me and i am a heavy user. i am always on my phone so the battery is nice. the phone is fast enough and it takes nice pictures not the best but it is still nice thou. nice phone. works great very well made. i don\\'t gat may this watch plizz can u tall me whay its so good!! sasdfygykygvcjytjytfytyctjtfhayjf! no ? ok bye. am not there one using it buh my dad and he says its slick ,smart ,beautiful too so am all in . love it great phone and easy not good the phone start giving me problems after couple days great conditions!!! i went to sprint service for two hours so i can activate it and they can\\'t do it because this phone is not for sprint, if i were you i wouldn\\'t buy this phone just save up your money nice purchase for someone not in need of a smart phone. it also has good text features and a hugh selection of blue tooth device connections. i received yesterday, when i installed the simm (wich is working on other unlocked iphone 4 32gb), i realized that it is not unlocked, because the simm is invalid. i need as urgent to solve this problem. please help me !!!!! i love apple, and the new iphone 5 is simply amazing, with a processor that never tires, a battery good durability, multifunctionality and versatility, i love it. got it for a first time smartphone user in their 50\\'s. had no problem learning the ropes and looks and feel comparable to any $500.00 smartphone. great product, blu! excellent worst phone i\\'ve ever had. slow and glitchy and terrible... excellent phone, fast thin and wonderfull. everything arrived on time. great seller . responsable. it is larger and easier to type upon. pretty color. bought wrong sim card since verison towers serve my area and tracfone uses them not at&t. i misunderstood which was needed in a sim card because phone isn\\'t to be under a verizon contract. when i went thru set up on phone i didn\\'t engage move ios to transfer data from android. you have one chance and can not go back and transfer data later unless you clear every out and start from scratch . so now i am entering manually many contacts . iphone needs to let the buyer know. nice phone great phone, but one suggestion. if it is going to be sold as \"unlocked\", root the phone so that it is possible to remove all of the original provider\\'s junk. unlocked or not, it still operates like a phone i would have expected from one of the providers: apps launch on startup, and run in the background, sucking up resources at every turn possibly communicating with who knows, and without rooting it myself, cannot be uninstalled. if i am paying retail for this, and not through a provider, the buyer is the admin. make them a true owner. great phone at a great price móvil data don\\'t works with metropcs, sometimes it works, most of them times it don\\'t. i am a very satisfied customer and would highly recommend this seller. it is good but the camera is of very poor quality.. it has lot of functions, but sorry to say the phone was lost due to my negligence... i love this phone. beautiful and amazing to use. the only problem is that after a few days the charger stopped working. it basically refused to charge my phone, or anything else for that matter. cons: its okay phone however, not seeing the long battery life it claimed to provide. this is main reason i picked this phone for my son. the prenstalled apps make it hard to set the display for your own personal needs. it does not allow you to delete some apps already on the display. these apps are something my son would never use. it really takes away the hold ideal of having an unlocked phone. if my son didn\\'t really need a phone right now i would probably send it back. its kind of thick for its size but that\\'s because of the battery that\\'s being used. i did expect that as a needed measure. i have used it to charge another phone yet, so cannot comment on that feature.pros: the phone looks good in person. so far it seems to load apps and surf the web okay. the camera takes reasonable pictures. these is an editing option which allows you to change the picture somewhat. nice and affordable i bought this phone in anticipation of replacing my very old quad band phone that i use for asia and europe. the price was good, and in spite of the poor reviews i decided i\\'d give it a try. big mistake. the first one wouldn\\'t hold take a charge, so i asked for a replacement. same problem. this phone is useless. i guess i\\'ll go to best buy and get one that actually works. don\\'t waste your money or time, and especially don\\'t waste your frustration on this useless piece of plastic. you need to remove it from your roster. it only gives amazon a bad name. i\\'m happy with my purchase. item arrived as described on amazon web page. the phone works perfect, like anything have to get used to all the new features. i simply placed my old sim card, and phone worked automatically. \\xa0when i first saw the micro x s240, i would have bet money that it was a toy phone for toddlers, letting them emulate their parents and older siblings with their real cellphones. but it\\'s not a toy, it\\'s a full-fledged genuine android smartphone. weighing only 1.85 ounces with a 2.4-inch display, it\\'s by far the smallest smartphone that i\\'ve seen.to get the phone up and running, after removing the back of the phone, i inserted a micro-sim (15mm x 12mm) and an 8 gb micro-sd card into the slots in the sides of the phone. then i inserted the 650mah battery. before using the phone, i charged the battery with the included 5v/0.5a ac adapter, then turned on the phone. connecting to my home wi-fi was quick. the phone came with about thirty preinstalled apps, and i downloaded and installed about a dozen more apps. several of my apps required setting up with my user id and password. not being familiar with the tiny virtual keyboard that pops up when you need it, i was making a lot of mistakes. i tried using a stylus, but i found that i did better using my finger. then it dawned on me to connect my bluetooth keyboard to the phone\\'s bluetooth, and that solved the problem. since then, i\\'ve gotten better at typing on the phone\\'s keyboard, but if i had to do a lot of typing, i would use the bluetooth keyboard. by the way, the little phone has google voice recognition, which also can save on the typing.the phone came with android 4.4.2 (kitkat) installed. one of the things i love about android is that when i signed into my google account, my phone contacts and chrome bookmarks synced and were available immediately. the phone uses most of the android conventions, such as the power/volume down buttons to take a screenshot.the screen display is 432x240 (160 dpi). that\\'s much lower resolution than larger smartphones on the market today, but as a practical matter, i watched some sports and a few videos, and the images were surprisingly viewable for such a tiny display, although the visibility is somewhat dependent on the viewing angle, as i demonstrated in the accompanying video.with a 650mah battery powering the dual core processor and the 2.4-inch (diagonal) display, i wondered about the battery life. i tested the battery by streaming full-screen video over wi-fi with the sound on low volume, and the battery lasted for 2:50. for typical mixed use of phone calls, web browsing, reading, music, and apps, i expect that the battery will last considerably longer than that. after draining the battery, i used the included ac charger to recharge the phone, which took about 2½ hours.the audio from the tiny speaker on the back of the phone isn\\'t high fidelity by any means, but it\\'s not too bad, considering the size of the phone. with no background noise, the maximum volume is satisfactory, but as with some phones and small tablets that i\\'ve used, you may want to have an auxiliary speaker handy if the ambient noise is high. a set of earphones is included with the phone; the earphone cable has a microphone that can be used for hands-free phone calls.the phone has front and rear cameras. the rear camera is 5.3 mp (3072x1728), with the front camera having 1.9 mp (1600x1200). the cameras have a limited set of camera controls, including autofocus and a 4x manual zoom. the camera also shoots 640x480 video, and you can zoom in or out while shooting. overall, the cameras are nothing special, but they\\'re okay. (note: i determined the resolution of the cameras using benchmarking software. the numbers i got differ from those shown in the product description.)as i mentioned, i put a micro-sim into the sim slot. it was a prepaid sim from a service that used t-mobile in our area. i made and received some phone calls and text messages. the call quality was excellent. i did not purchase a data plan, so i was not able to test the gps.after i inserted the 8 gb micro sd card, i used the phone settings to make the sd card the default for writing. the phone has 4gb of internal storage memory, and after you account for the operating system and the preinstalled apps, you\\'re not left with a lot of available memory - about 2.5 gigabytes - so don\\'t count on installing hundreds of apps. the micro sd cards are so inexpensive now that it just makes good sense to use one if you want to store a lot of books, music, videos, and apps on the phone. i connected the phone to my pc with the included usb charging cable, and it appeared in windows explorer as a usb mass storage device (as did the micro-sd card in the phone). that enables you to drag and drop files between the pc and the phone.i used the antutu benchmark app to see how the phone compared to other android phones, and it scored 10,051. that\\'s very low compared to high-end smartphones which score over 100,000, but it\\'s actually higher than some current smartphone models. i\\'m not geeky enough to discuss the merits of the phone\\'s 32-bit dual core 1.0 ghz cpu, but subjectively, the phone appears in most respects to be fairly responsive.the phone comes as part of a package which includes an ac power adapter and charging cable, and a set of earphones.the bottom line: it looks like a child\\'s toy phone, but the posh mobile micro x s240 is actually a surprisingly capable android smartphone. it\\'s definitely an eye-catcher. one of my teenaged nieces saw it sitting on a table when her family came by for a visit, and she had a fit wanting it. i may let her have it later, but not until i\\'ve had some fun with it. okay, compared to a full-size phone, the micro x s240 is awkward and slow when you\\'re typing on its tiny keyboard, and the small display screen may challenge your eyes, but it\\'s the most portable smartphone that i\\'ve seen, and i have to give it 5 stars for the ingenuity of the designers for cramming so much technology into such a miniature device. and yeah, the \"cute factor\" is off the charts.the phone was provided to me for evaluation. i did not promise to post a review, but i stated that if i did review the product, it would be an honest, unbiased review. great phone! to change launcher...download new launcher, go to app settings of old launcher, \"clear defaults\" and hit back. you then should be able to select a new launcher... which is key, cause the stock launcher sux if you hate iphone system. love the phone! get screen protectors even though its gorilla glass3. enjoy bliss! excellent team all good, i arrive at its stipulated time. excellent! it works well but the pictures from its camera are not the best!it does not take all apps all of my family is a windows phone lover.. 4 lumia 620\\'s + 1 htc 8x.i liked htc 8x for better resolution, larger screen, better camera, and slim profile - so i thought of upgrading one of the last remaining \"blackberry\" with this one. i love the wp8 os, and i\\'ve been using it since over a year and have had no trouble on any of my devices with microsoft updates/manufacturer updates, etc.this phone arrived just on time, but i immediately noticed the box was not an htc box. it was a generic box. with self-printed sticker on the box indicating it\\'s an htc phone. the box contained charger, phone, the sim-card-insert-pin/clip, headphones. no manuals.also noticed that the screen-protector was not original -- it seemed someone may have removed the original and placed a new phone without much care - and left many streaks/air-bubbles etc.nonetheless, i turned on the phone, activated it and setup using outlook account. and phone restarted suddenly -- there was no windows update or anything. i thought may be i did something. i checked through setup also, and it showed there were no update available. phone remained on for couple of hours and then it would continue restarting every 2-3 minutes, to a point where it completely died. i could not power it on.i returned the phone and received the full refund.my opinion of this *particular shipment*: this phone either was not an original htc, or it was a refurb. either way, htc / 8x / wp8 are have never given me trouble until this phone. so again, the problem must be with this particular inventory item.here is my review of lumia 620: http://www.amazon.com/review/r22zf0xaeudtll/ref=cm_cr_rdp_perm?ie=utf8&asin=b00fp2pe22&linkcode=&nodeid=&tag= wondersul experience seller is awesome, product is delivered as expected and working perfectly great product arrived on time and works as supposed to. no good battery die so fast u need to plug in with the charger 24/7 so don\\'t waste ur money this is the worst phone i ever had. can\\'t see the keyboard cause its not lighted and thats the biggest problem i had with this model i bought this phone and was sent to miami .my father brought him to argentina for team use. but is dosen\\'t working. the please returnar money it\\'s doesn\\'t work in certified refurbished you bought this cellphone and his charger and the phone it\\'s doesn\\'t work when i bought this cellphone i was really worried, because i was buying from peru. but i was really pleased with it, it works great just what i needed to use in my university, i had no trouble with compatibility with the phone company from here, the only thing that bother me a little is that i cant connect to 4g network but i\\'m not sure if it the cellphone or the phone company! i was expecting to receive it in black, but it was white.however, it was seized by the french customs so i had to pay 109 to take it back.disgusting!!! not what is advertised at all, the clip nor the packaging had anything to do with the \"otterbox\" brand i\\'ve gotten this phone twice. one for my wife and one for myself and both come two days earlier from the date it was suppose to come. the phone itself is wonderful and works great nothing off from it. i recommend to buy this phone from here if you in need of a cheep phone thus will work in a pinch i was really happy with the phone, it was great, but after 3 months of using it the wifi and bluetooth connectivity started to fail until it stopped from connecting to all networks.factory reset or repairing android with pc companion didn\\'t solve the issue.apparently this is a very common defect. i recommend carefully reading of sony support forums, just search online for \"xperia zr wifi issue\" on your favorite search engine before buying this. you will find a lot of complains.note that my phone was never in contact with water or dropped, flashed or anything else.i recommend carefully reading of sony support forums (search online for \"xperia zr wifi issue\" before buying this).sadly xperia care is not supporting the warranty outside the u.s.[update] i managed to send it over to sony, after explaining the issue several times, the unit was replaced for a new one. i hope it lasts this time. excellent product and seller worthy a-star, but the problem lies in the same machine moving and difficult transitions between menusand clarity of the screen and the camera is very bad because the screen broke, unfortunately, after installing the battery and this shows that the device must be dealt with ktaaof with a bomb that is to say a very sensitive device at any impelling unbreakable such as eggthis is my point of view the device in either the seller is excellent and dealing with a very sophisticated i visor this product is a waste of money. the thing only worked for a half a day. the directions make no sense, they are written in an attempt at english. the pedometer is not accurate at all. save your money. do not buy this product! great phone i was really happy with it except i couldn\\'t get more then 2g on metro or t-mobile i want to return it but i don\\'t know how nice good descriptions, just as said. i use this as a lightweight wifi enabled music player for the gym. i\\'ve also installed a clubcard app so i scan my gym card with the phone. it\\'s a real head turner! it works really, really well! works great the two headphone no good works great so far. compares well to expensive phones this phone was awesome until it stopped working. almost 6 months to the day after i purchased this phone the screen stopped working. it wasn\\'t frozen, it just would not respond to any input. i looked at my options with the seller for return and repair. nothing. i called samsung twice and they said that they couldn\\'t help me. samsung said that the phone was from australia and that i needed to call samsung in australia? really! anyway, this phone does not come with a factory warranty and if it malfunctions you\\'re out of luck. samsung did not offer me a repair option even if i were willing to pay for it. so, i\\'m a little smarter now. first, don\\'t spend this kind of money without getting some kind of warranty. second, samsung should be take more responsibility for their product\\'s quality and durability. i understand that samsung makes millions of phone every year and that a lemmon will sometimes make it to the market but they should take care of customers when that occurs. the nexus 5x is unlocked, much cheaper and comes with a 1 year warranty and you can buy additional coverage for under $70. i miss a few of the bells and whistles that the s6 had but i love the idea that no matter what the reason, if my nexus 5x fails i\\'m covered. but, on the other hand there are a few things that the nexus is better at then the s6. consumer reports gave the s6 a test score of 78 and the nexus 5x a 77. the highest test score was 80 for the s7. everything about this phone is very good, except one thing. the rear facing camera is disappointing, pictures are far from being good. the front facing camera is very good.other than that i really like it. love it!!! great phone for the price. good item this phone did not meet my expectations since the phone did not workalso the front screen not working . at times when scrolling photos i don\\'t get to see the images . otherwise so far no complaintswill recommend to others scam muy bueno great phone at a very good price. the battery life (3300 mah) is awesome. loving it. the phone arrived on time. works great. my teenage daughter is happy. what else can i say...also a great price. all perfectly i have had mine since february and i love my phone!!! 🙌 good 💯 excelent thanks from venezuela excellet excellent muy bueno good phone very new works great apple is very proprietary. if you can deal with the mass limitations, even between other apple products, it\\'s a decent smartphone. it is hugely over priced though. excellent seller 100% recommended it s ok! thank this is no phone but a plastic toy parked to defraud. hard to figure out with very little instructions could not have been more pleased the product say \"nokia lumia 920 black factory unlocked\", but comes with software in italian!!!!!... i am right now in venezuela, am living here, and the phone don\\'t have the spanish language... i hope than update the software of the lumia, add more language, included spanish... i buy some nokia in teh past, e71 and e6-00 wich says factory unlocked, and the soft is clean, in english originally, but i can change to spanish easily... i espected more of this phone, but the saler sad me... so sorry. my first reviews was an error. thanks very mucho, i and very happy with this phone. i love my crackberry! great small phone for the basics calls. great phone for the price! bought the unlocked version on my own, independent of any carrier. using it with consumer cellular service. takes great photos! nice, simple phone. great hd screen. large, yet lightweight. comes with case, screen protector and charger. full package at a great price. i\\'m very happy with this purchase. i\\'m sure htc mini m4 is a great phone, especially its size and it\\'s audio system. i tried to save a few bucks by buying it from a third party vendor over amazon. what a waste of money.the phone i bought behaved like a non commercial release. it came with korean apps that couldn\\'t be uninstalled. one of which would play the phone\\'s ringtone in unexpected hours, and for no known reason. tried to root it in order to uninstall default apps, and made it a brick. do yourself a favor and spend the extra bucks and but from a retailer. great phone, everything you need in small size. just like i want.but when i received it, the box wasn\\'t sealed, but still new.thx i absolutely love this phone. feels great in hand, no gliching, no problems and pretty fast compared to the phones i have had in the past. i would definitely recommend this phone. it \\'s a excellent product i love this thing! i had the samsung galaxy s3 mini and this blows it away. it is a little larger, which i would prefer it to be the same size, but oh well, can\\'t complain too much. when i turned it on, it asked for a pin, so i had to look up how to perform a factory reset and that took care of the issue. it is an international, so it has a funky wall plug but that\\'s okay. also, you\\'ll have to play with the settings so you can actually understand the language. screen will scratch eventually, even with very little use. probably good to get a protective screen. other than that i like it a lot it worked for a few days and since then will not. tried everything. called verizon for they help also, but no luck. now doesn\\'t even recognize there is a battery that is fully charged in the phone. great phone in every way. fast, smooth, takes great photos (way better than my previous nexus 6p), extremely well made and just beautiful. i didn\\'t buy this to use as a phone, i bought it as a replacement for a sandisk clip player. so the review is on this aspect.i got the phone. signing in was a bit annoying with a tiny keyboard, but still doable. i went and downloaded poweramp. i also bought a small clip for the phone and i used a 64 gig micro sd card with music on it.poweramp works fine. it took forever to build the database of music, but after that, it was great.the charger problem is true. some of my cables work, some don\\'t. anything with a fat head on it, isn\\'t going to work.i used a pair of headphones with media controls on it, and they work fine. able to switch tracks on it with no issues.overall, good. 1 star less for the cable issue though. and for the love of god, please someone make a hard rubber case for this phone with a clip built in!update:ugh. after just 1 week with it, it broke. no longer powers on. trying to contact posh about it. will update. i like it but only complaint is batter excellent phone. ! good reception , good graphics and perfect working demo in venezuela . i recommend it for the price value . i loved the phone but 4g isn\\'t supported in the us for this phone and that was a deal breaker for me. i even contacted samsung customer support and they couldn\\'t help with this either. sad that i had to return it. ok i love it! especially, the duos sim cads. great phone at a great price. this is a phenomenal idea. i actually keep three cards in mine, and i hope to never go back to digging through my pockets for my credit card or carrying a wallet. the only problem is that i\\'m on my fourth case in probably a little over a year. the tiny plastic hinges that hold the door on tend to break if the phone is dropped, even lightly. otherwise, great product. this case fit the phone just fine but the holes for the two speakers are way off. it completely covers the back speaker and the small hole where you talk. i would not recommend this product. i purchased 2 cases, from two different sellers. the other case i purchased was great. it was the blu armorflex pc+silicon case for studio 5.0c hd - carrying case - retail packaging - neon pink+blue. it fits well and is comparable in color and style of this one. good size but freezes all the time. received the phone after waiting 2 weeks when it was released was and super excited after it was on sale for 85 bucks! i had to buy it! there is a lot to talk about lol the phone has 2 sim cards, slot 1 is for 4g and 3g signal while slot 2 is 2g next to the battery which you must removed to access. dont forget the sd card slot. battery life is great it lasts me to the end of the day just from texts, videos and web. the screen is awesome 5.5 inches, 720p goodness! i have big hands and it is still hard for my thumb to reach to the corner of the screen, capacitive buttons to squeeze out more size i would assume. volume buttons and the power button are located on the right side of the device, headphone jack on top and charger port on the bottom. weight on the phone is okay though it is not balanced very well, there have been times where ive had the phone go over my index finger. (big hands) the camera is okay 8mp with a led light to accompany it. front camera is 2mp which i dont really care for unless youre a selfie person or for skype for pictures youll be using those filters to help the image quality lol. the back speaker is a bit too loud in my opinion. great phone for the price! bloat-free, i have rooted the device with kingo root. now the bad stuff oh boy..bad!1. the smartphone did not attempt to read my 32g sd card, ive tried many cards on the device and nothing. i asked for a replacement for the dead sd slot which came in to days woo! grabbed the new replacement aaaaaand it did not work! really frustrating since i have tons of music on those cards.2. on both devices ive had the same problem. the battery seems to be picky about what phone charger can and cant charge it! what the...3. while charging, the top half of the huge screen becomes unresponsive! bringing down the notification bar at the home screen is almost impossible while charging. (maybe its the voltage coming into the device??)4.so many bugs on the ui, such as the swipe lock screen. i touch the bubble swipe to the right and the it unlocks and locks immediately! to access my home screen i must go through my notifications bar and menus menus menus. another example, the dial pad, dialing numbers lags really bad.5. im not sure if it is specific apps (youtube etc.) or the wifi hardware, but while watching 720p videos they seem to buffer too often. making hd videos almost unwatchable. it could be the 4.4.2 kitkat os that is contributing to 95% of these problems and hopefully they will be fixed with the 5.0 lollipop upgrade which the eta on that is unknown. otherwise its a good starting phone with decent specs but if problems continue to arise i might will return this phone and spend 75 bucks more for a better upgrade. i could bump to 4 stars if 5.0 lollipop comes in. i would recommend the smack its a great phone gloria thanks vb after reading several reviews i decided to buy the phone and test it out. i activated on at&t network and all the apns were automatically setup. i am getting 4glte speeds. just like other reviews stated it does not have an app drawer i tried to use the google launcher but did not like the functionality. i instead opted for nova launcher and really like the options it gives to customize. i tried to download apps from the amazon app store but it kept causing my phone to crash to i stuck to just downloading apps from the play store. there has been no lag even when running several apps at once. it does have a great speaker that is really loud. item was clearly used, as it arrived in a torn box with an extra charger and headphones that were not listed in the items included on the side. device was also fully charged and running the latest software update available. it is, however fully functional and in good condition. awsome phone a1 products seems to be as described and in great condition! arrived on time but without promised case and the sync cord was super cheap but i didn\\'t really buy it for that purpose. the phone is very good and that is certainly what counts! phone looks great and works great a great phone. sleek and fast. arrived on time and in the expected condition in original box and factory unlocked. great memory expansion up to 124gb. sharp screen. very pleased! this phone is a good phone it does support 3g h+ at practically 4g speeds with atnt in usa and has a good screen it\\'s touch screen isn\\'t the most sensitive but just use regular screen protector don\\'t use tempered glass protector regular one works much better it is a good phone but you need to have software version a916_s1205_141013 either installed using custom recovery zip flashed or scatter loaded using mtk mt6592 flash tool on the computer because if you don\\'t do it then youtube may not work and system will be laggy and if you do the research you will find the phone number that activates the ability to have 2 sim cards at the same time so pretty much if you know what your doing then buy this phone but if you don\\'t then pick a different phone to purchase fortunately my lenovo a916 works good after doing research just takes patience it\\'s ok. unfortunately it doesn\\'t work like the one it replaced. got it for my grandson to replace one he lost. the watch works well camera so so music plays ok. you must have a sim card for for everything else to work . his other one would cannect to his ear piece and facebook and internet without a sim card. had to amend the review. 1 it only has five faces to chose not many and when playing music the battery died in less then one and a half hour. haven\\'t figured out how to make it work yet. for the price, which at my time was $39, this is about as \\'smart\\' as it gets. the internal storage is garbage, and the 512 mb ram really (as of 2016) puts it in the child\\'s toy category, but if for some reason you need a really, really cheap, basic android capable smartphone, this is the one. of the 4 gb of internal memory that you get, less than half is usable, because android itself takes up most of the space. many people agree that android really starts taking a hit if you make it run on anything less than around 512 mb internal storage free, so that basically leaves you with like 1 gb for documents, apps, music, movies, etc. there is an expansion card, however, with 4.4/kitkat not all apps are able to be moved to external storage, so most of your apps will still need to reside within phone memory, unless they do some kind of update which isn\\'t likely from either google, at this point, or even less from blu. they do not support their phones very well, this is not the first blu phone i have bought. i\\'d almost bet you 10 bucks that you will not be getting 5.0, or anything really from blu, on this phone, pretty much ever, unless you root it and do it yourself. not worth it, anyway. i bought it for a friend of mine that came to visit from europe and found out that they couldn\\'t use a prepaid sim with their phone. they needed a cheap smartphone that could take a prepaid card, so that they can check their email and use the uber app -- for that purpose, the phone performed well. excellent user friendly, technologically sound. i am someone who does not want a smart phone. i like the link because it\\'s compact, the keyboard is easy to use, camera is decent, has speaker phone feature, blue tooth adaptable; i\\'m totally satisfied. i tried the alcatel which looks like the link but it\\'s an inferior phone. this is a great phone and the price is awesome. especially since at&t is selling it for twice the price and if you get it through their next program it\\'ll cost more. my only negative thing about this phone is the color of the pictures. they have a pinkish/reddish light to them no matter how you adjust the settings. if it weren\\'t for that i would have given it 5 stars. very good this is the best phone i\\'ve had the opportunity to experience. it is very practical in it\\'s function and ability. having the functionality of a phone and larger viewing area has allowed me to move from a phone and tablet to this one great device. the phone was clean barely showed signs of usage excellent condition i took this phone to the verizon store and already have an account. i was unable to get my email accounts added to the phone. the phone looks great; however, it is difficult to understand, and i have windows 8.1 on a laptop. the phone was extremely hot as i charged it. i would not recommend it. it just has one camera and with low quality nice for its price awesome solid phone, screen is nice, i changed the launcher to google now launcher the instant i got it, to give it a stock feeling and the battery life is awesome good phone for the price.. im happy with it excelent too beautiful all good nice, better than i spected good it\\'s pure junk get a gear at least it will charge cheap is as cheap does that what mammie used to say love it!!! good basic pone... works very well with companies in venezuela (movilnet, movistar and digitel) great mp3 player! excelente i live in ecuador and it work perfect, it\\'s unlocked. i never had the iphone 6 so i can\\'t compared which is better but this cell phone is amazing! i am very successful and very thankful to have this magic and fantastic product, beause this is made of first hand materials i bought this phone it\\'s works well, but i have to buy an unlock code to use it on the other carriers. after using it for less than 5 months the phone just died. the screen flickered for couple of minutes then went totally black. i hear the phone starting and turning off. this is really a piece of junk. stay away excellent have had posh microx for a day now. it is not going to replace your full size android phone. no app drawer, cannot uninstall some apps. no weather widget available except native, closest city 50miles away. that being said, amazing for the 30$ i paid. i have lots of smartphones. doesn\\'t compare with my note or fire phone. would say it is about as good as my alcatel c1. other than the pros or cons of being super small. i would say its a solid low end android phone. fantastic phone ...... so glad i bought it ..... thinking of another one for my spouse ordered a samsung a3 and received a nokia lumia....dissapointed... love the phone. had it about a month now. upgraded from the galaxy s6. only issue was with seller. i ordered a black s6 edge + plus international in the color black. i received the right phone but in the color gold. also i noticed the info sticker on the box was covered with a new/different model #, ssid#, & different color then what i received. however all the #\\'s & info on the bottom under the \"new sticker\" matched my actual phone. other then that all is great. it came in. i charged it. inserted my at&t mini sims card, put in all my info to restore my stuff from my samsung & google accts, and it even downloaded the apps i had on my regular s6 so i didn\\'t have to do all that again. thank god! lol. it can be a pain setting up a new phone. took me about an hour to charge and completely setup. 35-40 mins to fully charge the battery. great i\\'m very disappoint with this product! i received another samsung phone that is not this one!... and to add, the product has a very bad quality, it\\'s extremely slow and the battery got bulged in just 3 months. i have been asking for this battery and everybody say that this is a chinese battery and it isn\\'t from the samsung, so for that it got damaged like that. happy with purchase after having used the phone for a week. fully functional and decent speed on at&t network. amazing what posh was able to do with such a small form factor. very light too.works well for calls, with good quality sound. of course typing is a challenge on such a small screen, but that\\'s to be expected. sending short texts and e-mails is the name of the game. only complaints are that removing the back cover is a real pain and, as others have noted, the charging cable micro usb has a long tip. you can find a few to buy on amazon, but these tend to be pricey. overall, quite pleased with the phone and its value. was not locked to sprint as stated i bought because in the page said that it works with 4g in argentina. that is false. touch screen stopped working after three weekswon\\'t buy another one nothing great about this. low quality resolution. it is worth ok $100 range. beyond that better off with anything else. the phone specs are great. if you are coming from samsung or even a sony xperia then the ui will need a small degree of learning curve.pros:great specs for the price, especially 4gb ramno bloatwarecons:battery fully charged barely lasts 24 hoursui needs some learning curve on the user\\'s partby far the biggest drawback - speaker output is horrible and can be best described as low energy and anemici ended up returning mine due to the battery and low speaker output. otherwise, the phone for the price is a bargain. it was what i expected, and delivered fast. this was for my wife and she loved it. i would recommend this product to others. i\\'m an android person and love the htc droid incredible 2. this is my 3rd incredible 2 and i will hate to have to change phones when it is not longer available! excellent product very disappointed. pre ordered the white with 16/2 im/ram. waited weeks for delivery only to be told it was not availabie. i ended up getting the white with less memory only to see the dark blue with increased memory available afterwards.overall i thought it was a good phone from blu but..... battery life not great. had phone for more than a week and the battery has to be recharged every day. 4g lte a must. really makes a difference. i had the blu energy x plus before, love the 5.5\" screen and 4000mah battery but it was not 4g lte.blu can\\'t seem to get it just right.5.5\" screen, 16/2 memory, 4g lte and a 4000-5000 mah battery. every other possible combination is available. come on blu get it right.1 month update - this phone has a tendency to just reboot itself at random. it will not receive mms\\'s unless you clear/delete other mms to /from other contacts. i guess the memory fills up so quickly. overall this is a real piece of garbage. i would not buy this phone. stay away. great smartphone. had it for a month now with no problems. battery lasts almost 2 days without a charge. upgrading to android marshmallow was easy. takes great pictures, even in low light. works seamlessly on att network. great phone. good deal.arrived in timely fashion outdated and palm doesn\\'t even host the server to register it to. it was a worthless purchase. i wish there was negative stars. the telephone works perfectly as all his accessories. excellent price and quality of the product. totally satisfied the experctativas. very advisable. pretty good for the price if anyone is interested to know how the 7 performs compared to the 6 and 6scamera is a little better and you notice it for sure. it is a lot better in low lights conditions.speed, i was using a 6s and i notice a much snappier safari and imessage screens. part of it may be ios 10 but pages pop really fast. it is way way faster than the original 6.black looks awesome!!! but is is so slick. there are no lines and it looks like a solid 1 piece product. i saw the glossy jet black and it is a work of art but it show fine scratches. so most people will use a case which hides the back anyway so maybe color is not that important. mainly if you want a white front or black.i love the new home button, took about 5 minutes to get use to and i don\\'t miss the old home button at all.any case with a large camera cutout like the cm4 wallet case works with the 7. but most likely all other will not. some of mine i can cut out around the old camera hole and use it until new cases come out. but i promise you this phone is slippery when dry!!overall i love it! fastest device that i have ever used. i can out type the 6s sometimes on reviews but thiamine keep up no problem.128g is perfect in size for most everyone. hardcore photo and video people may want the 256g.no headphone jack, doesn\\'t bother me at all. the adapter sounds fine with my expensive headphones. it\\'s not really that large either. the lightning headphones sound really good to me. i tested the same song with the same headphone using a 6s and the 7 with the adapter and i cannot tell the difference. in some ways the 7 with the adpater sounded cleaner and had a little less aliasing hiss from the analog to digital conversion process. so beside have a little while cable sticking out i think the 7 audio is fine.iphone 4,5, 5s, se and 6 users will feel a huge speed increase. the 6s is not far off speed wise but it is noticeable to me.no matter how you split up the payment or go with a upgrade contract price, you\\'ll pay full price for any of the phones. it is all just creative math by the vendors. i bought mine outright and got point on my credit card, enough to reduce my price by $25.00. i also heard the black and jet blacks maybe high in demand.hope this helps :) so nice phone and very cheap love it this is the worst phone i\\'ve ever had....software glitches...shuts off n won\\'t come back on....sensor for talking is bad...n i\\'ve only had it a month..don\\'t waste ur money!!! great for what it is and offers, can\\'t beat it for 30 bucks love very nice phone the phone is horrible everything ok! 100% advisable! very good i am in love with this phone! i bought it in gold...shipping was right time. battery life is great if you are a light user. if you are a heavy user like myself, you will have to charge at least once for the day. i bought this for my dad. it got delivered really fast and in great packaging and the phone works great. can\\'t even tell its been used. he loves it. 5 stars purchased the phone because it was said that it\\'s compatible with straight talk. just a waste of money. lovely and exciting i love my phone, the camera takes wonderfull photos. the battery whent dead after three months but i guess it\\'s a bb\\'s problem and not from the seller simple gsm works as expected...nothing fancy...display and sound is good. easily support any gsm sim worldwide the shipping was great and i got it ahead of time but i am a go phone pay as you go user and the phone wasn\\'t compatible; the battery ran down as i watched, from full to zip in just minutes. i returned the phone for a refund because it was defective. a better product for a younger crowd? yes, i think so. speedy delivery but the ear piece is vey low and charger stopped working after two weeks. i bought i phone 4 and this i phone supposed to be used like new but i surprised when i found the back camera is scratched and not working , really it was very bad it worked gr8 the sony xperia z3 must be the smartphone world\\'s best-kept secret, seriously. this is superior to the samsungs i\\'ve owned.all you samsung suckers out there should give the sony xperia line a look. i love the phone. its beautiful and feels nice in the hands too. a lovely upgrade from the iphone 4s received this phone from warehouse deals. everything admittedly worked except the most important thing, the sim card slot. you would put in a sim and it didn\\'t recognize it. i have returned so amazon so now i\\'m waiting on my refund i have to send it back there was some initial confusion with this phone, however i have since learned that it wasn\\'t necessarily the sellers fault.they have gone above and beyond to help remedy the problem we encountered with the sprint phone.they have opened up a line of communication and are doing everything possible to have a satisfied customer. great phone. me gusto fantastic product, arrived in time and everything was factory sealed. i wish the battery lasted longer, but that\\'s another story. excelente i have been using this phone for 3 weeks now and it is great! no joke, this phone works perfectly and is fast. no complaints except you can\\'t buy a lot of covers. a cover is included and works fine but you don\\'t have many choices other than that. i plan on buying another phone for my son.... excellent! i like it! love it ... great phone. very rugged. this phone looked like good deal until i received it. cosmetically the phones looks ok. feels sturdy. the main issue i had with it is that the screen looks grainy. youtube videos were hard to watch due to the low screen resolution and had a slight delay. according to the sales guide from blu, this phone has a resolution of 480x854 and 196ppi, did not see that spec before ordering the phone. i had so much hope for that phone......size was good and comfortable but screen quality wasnt good,i wish i would take risk and buy more cheaper phone even blu hd 5 and yezz andy 5m had a more clear screen quality i got the phone yesterday...trying to switch on, was not turning on, so i left it for more than 12 hrs charging, and still not working...what do i have to do?? disaster... friendly and easy to use. i bought this phone to my wife, after a very deep research about pros/cons and other consumers comments.i used for about 2 weeks and then my wife is using it for more than a month, without any problem. she is not a \"friend of technical stuffs\", but she is operating some functionalities without problem and every day she shows me something new that she learned by herself. this means that symbian is very easy to understand, learn and follow.the double keypad/keyboard is very good and the camera better than the e71 (my phone).gps works fine almost all the time (faster to initialize than in the e71).the only 2 cons:1- apparently the wireless antenna is in the top of the phone, so when you are browsing, writing with the extended keyboard, the left hand normally is over the antenna and the wireless signal is not good at all (usually loose connection)2- the memory slot cover was made with plastic (the e71 is with rubber) and if you have no enough care (or long nails) probably you will damage it and then will be very difficult to open. great phone foe the price. i\\'ve had no problems and everything has been running without issue. this is my second posh so i decided to go with the larger screen. easy to see and i even read books on it. excelente my brother love it i love my old htc sensation. i drop that one and the screen got broken. i decided to buy the same one because it was so inexpensive! well, the camera works but i can\\'t make videos... so that is why it was so inexpensive? good phone and for the price the phone is great. worked perfectly with tmobile. will be buying another for gf. good. recommendee for y\\'all androids user this (china\\'s) product fell apart after around 3 months of use. phone is working fairly ok but with some noise sometime. belt fell apart due to the nature of plastic.the belt is anchored by plastic anchor hidden inside of belt and was torn apart after sometime. although lots of time plastic / rubber belt of any type of watch would break, this one is exceptionally bad.the back cover deformed after a while.please see attached image.when request warranty, the seller pushed this to amazon and attempted to reject the warranty process.bluetooth is not working too great to auto-reconnect. you simply have to manually connect bluetooth. excellent horrible keyboard and it broke after a month great my original atrix had a busted screen. the cheapest fix was $160 bucks (the screen is part of the display and have to replace both at same time). i figured i would take a chance on this phone for the price. i am so glad i did. the phone had no scratches on it (i was surprised to be honest) and worked as new! we have only had it a few months now but i have had no problems with it at all. my husband has had his for over a year and drops it about once a week (roughly a 6 ft drop) and it still holds up. there honestly was no difference between this one and a brand new one. would buy again! came with charger and headset, no memory card, really nice phone hi, my phone isn\\'t work the screen was balck and not working more. the suport htc online said thas is a test equipment and he can\\'t market. the imei is a test equipmet. iwant my money to return :( perfect. delivered early. no problems whatsoever. bien poor qualitydo not reccomend buying this producthad faults and had diff back coververy tacky over all . it stopped working after few months. i did not even bother to return it. there are much better phones out there than this one. that\\'s great product worked well for 1 week, after that, back button start to “ghost pressing” ,first only few times (causing apps closing) and after few hour i can’t use the mobile anymore. now when you open an app, it takes only few seconds to close due to back button problem,. its now seven days since i receive my new phone. .unfortunately it never yet vibrate plus it works only for the very two days i first got it...not impressive at all....i try to reach customer service for help questions but unsucessful... i really appreciated the phone terrible thing! it takes big knife or screwdriver to open battery cover. people who are married with their phones can probably guess how it opens, but manual does not describe it. tried many tricks, big knife was the only successful. will throw it away, to cheap to return. the device doesn\\'t work , i will be returning it . great phone i ordered black, got platinum instead... nice for price i\\'m very satisfied with my purchase better than expected . . . it is very good. and easy to use. contains apalicaciones good and excellent space for storage. ofrece una buena experiencia. it disconnects with no warning and no reason. the phone can right beside of the watch and it will still disconnect very satisfied, exactly how it was described. the cutest android! i love it i would have given it a higher rating, but i had to get a sim card holder installed on the phone. other than that the phone seems to be working fine. phone is in very good condition and was well packaged. product ok totally in love with this phone what can i say works fast both cameras work wonderful just love it......using in the caribbean (barbados) great seller. super piece. battery lasts for 2 days without charging and with extensive use. features in the note3 are also far better than what its done before. even the search feature in settings makes it so easy to look for anything you want. all ok, thanks a lot i took it to haiti to give it to someone it doesn\\'t work, i need to return it, please so far i really like this phone, have no complaints yet. keeps blacking out they sent me 2 ...both did the same thing ..my daughter was disappointed extremely disappointed that this was received the first part of september and the screen is literally falling out of the phone. i\\'ve never seen anything like it before. my son saved his hard earned money to buy this product and not even 3 months later it is junk. hope to find someone that can help us to get it fixed. :(just took the phone to get fixed today and found out the phone is total junk! the battery is swollen and ready to explode. the parts inside were broke and some screws were missing. i watched the man open the phone and was in total shock! i can\\'t believe we were scammed so badly. this was not a new phone! i\\'ve had the original moto g for years and love it. when the 4g came out i was reticent because of reviews alleging a heat problem. i decided to get a 4g plus. at first i was a bit put-off by the larger size, which doesn\\'t feel as comfortable as the smaller g. i also noticed that the unit indeed warms up occasionally, when using the camera. after awhile i got used to the size, and came to really appreciate the larger, high rez screen. the camera is excellent. audio can sound a bit tinny if too loud, but that\\'s a minor complaint. build quality is excellent. overall a great phone. after 3 years of android becoming worse and more locked down with each new version, i switched to apple and after 3 months on ios i can\\'t believe how much i was missing in terms of stability and it \"just working.\" no more android for me. not even two weeks passed that the phone broke down. i doesn\\'t hold the charge;it doesn\\'t charge at all thru the usb port.took the phone for a revision on a local shop and they told me that the mini usb port was broken.the only way that i could use the phone is to buy an external battery charger and a second battery. it solve the problem of using the telephone but as you can inmagine , it will not ne able to synch with the bb desktop software if the phone needs and upgrate of os.very dissapointed that this happened. beware!!!dont buy this fone. it might look to you as a new fone but has been tampered with. i took it to apple and they verified that its still locked to verizon which is cdma. also they confirmed that this fone is showing a purchase date of 1978 which is completely wrong. so this fone has definitely been tampered with. no warranty.i would suggest not buying this fone. apple gave all the details to me in writing and said that this fone doesnt come under any warranty. be careful this is not a lte version. just 3g. drained battery and software and app couldn\\'t link up watch. frustrating... great phone, working well! very good. works perfect and works on at&t no problem very good thanks the features of this phone meet my needs; its 4g speed makes receiving email effortless, web browsing a snap, and of course receiving clear voice calls. the phone is an excellent choice for anyone considering a smart phone. this phone has a nice large screen, camera is good, speaker is phenomenal. the phone is pretty (not important but still worth mentioning). it comes with a protective case that is color coordinated to the phone. it comes with a screen protector. this phone is absolutely wonderful especially for the low price. i would definitely recommend this phone, and am considering buying another as i bought this for my daughter. if you are budget minded and want a nice phone for a pay as you go or no contract plan this is the ticket!!! works great. no issues to speak of . arrived quickly and as described it is a decent phone for a decent price. shipping was good. the phone is not the greatest but thats not the sellers fault its the creator of the phones fault. shipper was easy to deal with. i would rate the seller. 10 out of 10 would not recommend in 1 month it doesn\\'t work anymore i am exceptionally pleased. every feature works perfectly. it far exceeds the one i purchased years ago. kudos to pgd. its awe always freezing up on me. ands it slow to open up the apps, its even slow opening up the phone to make a phone call. this phone sucks. wish i never bought it. perfect phone for the price i just needed a simple phone for a trip from the us to jamaica. i know a phone with a sim card was needed so i got this one. it came with a charger unexpectedly (unfortunately the charger didn\\'t work), but the phone worked so thats what matters. the product was excellent. comes with a bad usb cable + charger. but the seller send a replacement asap. it was a new phone. very good i bought this phone and jus 17days after, the phone can not read my sim card no more. the phone freezes all the time, it is just crazy.\\xa0samsung s5830 galaxy ace - unlocked phone - black very fast shipping. love it! very good love how loud speakers are. i can listen to audio books all day while doing my work. the amazing amount of memory means i can download sooooooooo many apps and not run out of space. pictures, videos, audio books. this phone is compact compared to a computer yet does almost as much. perfect everything i\\'m super happy thank u works great i love it i couldn\\'t be happier with this phone and the seller was awesome they answered all of my questions before i decided to purchase and i am very glad i did purchase from this seller great buy the phone is just what i needed. its a lot faster than my last phone.i have most freinds with iphones. fast delivery.thank you really good, glad i purchased it. the phone works well. my only issue is memory - the phone memory is not sufficient to support normal usage. it might have been ok when the phone was first released, but not based on how large applications are in 2013. the memory is so limited that you cannot update any of the standard apps on the phone (i.e. those that you cannot remove without superuser access). for example the phone will not be able to support the latest google maps and facebook apps. in order to leave some memory for whatsapp, i had to prevent googleplay from updating any app on phone.once you get over the memory issue, the phone works well and has good reception (in nyc area). has been great phone for my 15 year old nieces first smart phone. this phone has not performed to expectation. the touch screen does not sense motion well. it has a very slow processing speed. after less than 18 months, i had to replace because it no longer worked. save your money and buy another model! for the price it\\'s a good buy. excellent deal. arrived on time, we\\'ll protected and new package nice case for the money... works great i\\'m from trinidad an it works on my carrier this phone was locked when i got it even though it says un-locked. this product is terrible glitches and will work not my straight talk data the phone looks like it was brand new, everything works perfect, no dents, no scratches. the shipping was really fast, arrived before time (usps). also it\\'s great that it\\'s unlocked, it works perfect with my mexican carrier (telcel), and i\\'m pretty sure i won\\'t have problems using it in the us with t-mobile. very good i have had the lg optimus which was great and then i went to what i thought was a better phone (motorola triumph) it was not. this samsung is by far the best 4g cell phone out there for virgin mobile i have no complaints! the 4 star is because wierdly, some of the apps i.e.: texting, the microphone does not appear for voice to text. one must type everything. for fat fingers, that\\'s difficult. also, with the microphone option, it\\'s much easier and faster. so that is disappointing! we will contact support to find out if there is a solution.something like the s5 non-mini, but a much different product. we needed the smaller size. i did like all the features and it worked pertaining to calling but the earphone volume was too low and i didn\\'t find a method to increase the volume. this is all is didn\\'t like on the phone and it was a necessity for me. it\\'s a really good phone better than i expected i updated the windows phone, installed a lots of apps... and it worked great!... graphics and tools were very useful... but suddenly, a reboot loop started, there is no way to stop it! the overheat damaged the microsd, so i replaced it, but the phone is not fixed yet. so i should try with a new battery (10$) because the official support can\\'t do anything for me. i purchased 2 of these phones for my kids and after just a few weeks, they are already complaining that the phone freezes. they have to remove the battery and sometimes reset the phone to factory settings to get it to be responsive again. not sure if it needs some updates or if the hardware is just not good. if anyone else has encountered these issues and has any fixes or work-arounds please let me know. otherwise i will continue to troubleshoot and see if i am able to come up with a fix. this product for the price it\\'s going at is very good surprisingly. the build of it feels very nice and has good weight to it as does the apple watch. it sucks that the screen isn\\'t hd, but, then again nothing under $100 on a smartwatch does, at least to my knowledge. the strap feels good in the hands and can probably last you a couple months, or years, depending on how well you take care of it! great phone for the money! you can upgrade the memory with a micro sd card 128g! i think that it is so because as with some other things we can find now, it was designed to give full capabilities, ruggedness, and long life to persons in non-first-world countries. thus the replaceable battery, the full set of bands and great performance of motorola\\'s most up-to-date designs, and even the size, which is comfortable and large enough.i\\'ve found performance to be excellent, all around an area which used to be somewhat fringe on a good sony feature phone. the 4g is flawless with t-mobile, when i want to pay for data by an add-on pass to my $3/mo pay-as-go plan, and it\\'s fast -- twice my cable internet.running on wifi, i\\'m surprised to find that even watching a film is satisfying, and the sound with good earbuds is rich.calls and receiving calls and sms can be entirely free on wifi, not using your minutes, if you are careful to understand setting up google voice and dialer. just be sure to understand that you don\\'t want forwarding to the phone when using this mode of google services, or they would go on your plan minutes.. get someone to help if the web instructions seem hard.the bonus is that this phone integrates wifi or 4g-data calling via google seamlessly, so that you use your phone in the slick way motorola has arranged it - just one extra tap as you make a call, to choose google or your cell provider.the marshmallow level of android is very well developed and smooth with motorola\\'s no-interference way of providing it -- plus the google services you can add offer quite a lot, even including what seem to offer just as much by now as siri. you can voice-type effectively, and there is swipe typing, a big advance on fingers or thumbs, if those are well provided for also. you can ask for google lookups in a moment, then return to the note you were writing or the call you are on. you can ask to make appointments. where to find a laundromat or a meal, and so forth., and it all actually works.i\\'d have to say that as an actual old hand on what goes into these things, i feel a real sense of using something already travelling into a future.the ads -- actually, the amazon ads are so far almost always tasteful, i know because i made an effort to look. if you have notifications, you are only going to see those ads as the same small notes,, very unobtrusive. i find the cacophony of other ads all through using some apps to be the real issue, and those have nothing to do with amazon. the answer to them is to choose your apps from those which are tasteful about this, and that is something you can easily do.your choice, then. if you\\'re not intent on spinning around with pokemon, or playing reflex-demanding games, you might also find this quite a valuable bargain. i would suggest trying one out in a store, to see about the size, and then you can also learn about the smoothness. style too, as this is always personal. this worked well for what i needed it for. can\\'t beat the price. used it in cuba and it worked just fine. very long battery life. giving it 3 stars because to access the battery is next to impossible. took several tries with a knife to pry the back off. it is not very user friendly in that respect. i love the phone!!! it\\'s light and a great size.👍 i got it in two days. saved my 300 dollar tablet from water.this otter box case is my hero and i will never use any over band again the article did not come with headphones, also wrong packed with other items to buy and mistreated i am clumsy, this works great! have a lot of problems, can\\'t hear phone calls have to use loud speaker. it works fine. bit of a hassle to get all the messaging and data function up and running. i still haven\\'t gotten the mms picture messages to send though.edit:the phone works great now, just had to add a new apn to run on my carrier\\'s data plan. the sound quality with the headphone jack is a bit poor, too much background static when nothing is playing. wish that it had more than 1gb of internal memory because it doesn\\'t always pick up that i have 16gb memory card in it. good the phone works very well, especially for the price. is not working eny more there is a problem with my samsung galaxy s6 edge. it says factory unlock international version except most of the time it disconnects automatically from the network even when there is a coverage. please advise. excellent i love my phone this is my second droid 3 my first one worked better the new one freezes and doesnt let me type when the battery is low i loved my first one but this one is not dependable does everything i want it to do and more 👍 very good phone for the price, but the battery charge did not last for the period mentioned in the tech specs. expected universal plug compatible with my other phone, no. i can not hear the other person on the phone. i turned up all of the volumes i could find, no help. i can\\'t use the phone. i expected it to be just like my other phone and i spent more because this one was brand new, not used. i had to get a different phone. great buy and fit my dad perfectly.. nice material and length! went back and bought another in a different color! camera is not clear but besides everything is good great real iphone 5s. came in factory box sealed up like an apple store would sell it to you. it has some better features than the 4 and is alot faster! i like it! i sanded down my old sim card for my 4 and it fit in my 5 (save $10-20 on a sim card at tmobile) nice love my phone. phone is exactly the same as written in the information page of the product. it is factory unlocked, and a non tmobile phone.thanks for shipment. (sold by: fgs trading) it came in perfect condition as if it were new. there are chips around the edges but i was expecting that. love the fact that it came with new headphones because i had lost my previous ones. the only thing is that the charger is not a good cord. if it is not plugged in the wall, it does not charge well. i tried to sync my phone through itunes on my computer and it kept telling me it cannot read or sync due to some error. i have to use my ipad charger but other wise. its good. great phone and good price.works great and fast,though the seller said the phone was used,the phone came sealed like brand new with all the accessories,thanks to surge telecoms absolutely fantastic device for the money. using it with at&t go phone account and never been happier. long day battery life, clean android interface, no weird bloatware uselessness. i chose this one for it\\'s small size because i have to text frequently while walking and this fits nicely in hands and with swype you can text solidly with your thumb keeping you other hand free. bought for deployment, protected my tablet great so far. all ports are easily accessible with case on. i\\'m also quite fond of the \"stand\" feature. great purchase. international version. did not work correctly. excelent item! this phone outperformed all my expectations of it. though it was supposed to be my temporary phone till i buy a one plus 2 or nexus, but because of this i have put my plans to upgrade on hold.does all it is needed out of a smartphone. and the best part is battery. it just does not die.if you want to play high performance games, this phone is not for you. if you are like me, interested in productivity, connecting with people, using social apps -- this phone will suit you. great watch for the price. if you are looking for more bells and whistles invest more money but for a test run with the smart watch market, this watch is great. it was shipped out in a few days and no hassle. the only thing i will suggest is to look at a few youtube videos on how to download the the bt notfification software. i would suggest using the barcode scanner to download the software. work very good, very good very well this cellphone scren is locked ,needed to enter pin , i don‘t know why ,anyonecan gime a advice? i have had this phone for only 2 months and when someone calls it reboots and the hot spot no longer works. i would think it would last longer than 2 months and when trying to return amazon stated my 30 days were up. really, 30 day warranty. bought blu products before and had better luck. not happy everything about this phone is perfect and works just as well as you would expect a flagship phone to work. absolutely no complaints about the phone. i\\'ve had the blu win hd before and i really liked it but it broke and i got a lumia, and then that lumia broke and i got this win hd. it looks pretty awesome and it\\'s performance is pretty good as well, i only have a few complaints. one is that when typing sometimes the phone does not recognize my touch. this can be kinda annoying at times, but for the most part it\\'s pretty responsive. another is the speaker, not very loud, which i don\\'t mind, but it also has a tendency to rattle and crack with some music. i bought this for $75 and it was lowered to 60 the next day (i was super bummed) but for 60 bucks, this is a great deal, especially if you love windows phone like i do. excellent!! iphone have some problems which wasn\\'t mention in the description a decent little phone. basic android setup but sharp. i need help works well to keep the phone from being damaged by dropping. excellent! amazing phones, good working good my phone\\'s audio is gone after 3months excellent product and fast delivery if you are looking for a basic phone for international use, this phone works perfectly in the suburban and rural areas of jamaica. just charge and buy a sim card (digicel or lime) in jamaica to add cell phone minutes. it felt nice and safe to have a phone to use soon as i entered the country. i was able to listen to the local jamaican radio stations using this phone. will purchase again for more international travel. perfect that was a real one i love my apple watch! i couldn\\'t tell it wasn\\'t brand new. it looks and works great and i got it at a fraction of what it would\\'ve cost brand new. charger port did not work. pink shadow on screen. had to returned it. glad i got my money back. lots of problems with charging phone. .. it\\'s a great device, works excellent here in venezuela really bad service!!!!! the phone that i have purchased has been modified in fact if i digit the imei , i could find out that the phone was set with tim mobile in usaso that i can not download updates since the software has been modified. the speakers does not work and i can repair since in htc europe does not have the same spair parts a in usa. i waste my oney and i ish to have it back great fone. i like it a lot so far. the quality of images and video is perfect. the only inconvenience is the weight. it\\'s really heavy, especially for someone like me who when from aaron samsung mini straight to more bulky one. works just fine! i thought it was brand new......thats how good it looks.... i wish there was more storage, but what i can say is that i really like this phone. pictures are great! i have had it now for about 4 months and am very satisfied. it is just like the galaxy everybody is going crazy over, i think the 5s or something. whatever it is my sister has it, only i paid alot less for mine! love it i have only had this phone for less than two months and it is already malfunctining on me. the messaging is wigging out!!! it has not been dropped, covered in a case, and not dropped in any water. there is no reason for the phone to freak out this way. i am unsatified with this and unpleased with the fact that the seller did not leave any contact information so that product may be exchanged. i am highly disappointed. 350.00 for a phone that is already screwing up!!! good replacements still working just fine. i love it, it is new and exactly as shown and described. thanks. very satisfied with thisproduct was misled told the device was knocked it was not. this is a nice little phone. there aren\\'t really many bells and whistles but for $100 it\\'s worth every dollar. one thing i found extremely useful personally is that while the calendar isn\\'t anything to write home about, it will sync up with microsoft outlook. lots of nice features but touch response slow. nice looking phone. i only use the phone for one week and i will write review again. sound volume poor. clip broke with in hours of use. could only get 2g or \"edge\" on att network. tried every apn setting possible. otherwise its good for a cheap phone, just don\\'t bother if you are data heavy.nothing worked better. suggest picking up amazon\\'s moto play for nearly same price. albeit the moto pushes advertisements. i love how well this phone holds on to a signal whenever i am in a call. once i get connected to a call, i seem to be locked onto it. so far, zero dropped calls. call clarity is better than my old iphone 6s. texting, using the phone\\'s messaging app, is simple but functional though a tad boring. battery life is very good and can last the whole day from 100% charge at 7am with heavy wifi and data use, streaming videos, phone calls (2-3 hours total) and heavy texting and ill still have around 55%-63% battery by 9pm. camera is just ok and nothing special though the manual mode is fun to use! the asus zenui is actually pretty interesting and the so-called \"bloatware\" can easily be disabled or uninstalled. what i am nervous about is the glass on the back of the phone which is cool to look at but in my opinion, an unnecessary embellishment. overall a solid phone if you\\'re after speed, stability, and signal. it was next to impossible to link it with my phone with that bar code no !!!! it did not work with metro pcs ..i couldn\\'t go on the internet it doesn\\'t look like how it is phone suit my needs and it works. this is a great phone no complain about except for the battery it runs out very quick but beside that is great.also i think its beautiful specialy the white oneyou wouldn\\'t regret it stronger then advertised. amazing case. excelente important: this device is not compatible with 3g on at&t nor t-mobile in united states. the spec of the r800\"i\" version only support the hsdpa 900 / 2100 bands, which neither at&t nor t-mobile in the us support. you will only get 2g speed. the r800\"at\" at&t version use the 850 / 1900 / 2100 bands. the great thing about this is t-mobile is beginning to enable support for 1900/2100 in various area, so if you manged to get an unlocked version of the r800at you can get 3g on t-mobile if you happen to live in one of those 1900mhz supported location.i have owned devices like the galaxy s3 and galaxy nexus, i sold them and goes back to the xperia play because for someone who love classic console gaming there is no better choice as a phone. bluetooth gamepads just doesn\\'t do it for me because they\\'re not really portable and can take time to setup.great things about this device:-the gamepad: i won\\'t have to explain this.-durability: it\\'s quite durable and can easily withstand \\'reasonable drops\\'. i have less concern about accidentally dropping this device than dropping highend devices with gorilla glass.-sound quality: audiophiles might realize that there are not a lot of android phones with great sound quality. the headphone output quality is very good and to my ears comparable to the original galaxy s which is another android device with great sound.-agps and glonass support: this allow it to get reasonably fast location fix and stay fixed. its not the most accurate, but for a being an older device its very acceptable and probably better than many other devices that only have agps.-camera: for being a 5mp camera with led flash it can take decent photos. it\\'s about 90% as detailed as the galaxy nexus 5mp camera, but is better with low light situation. it can record videos at 720p with continuous autofocus. however, there is a big flaw with the camera microphone\\'s volume being extremely quiet.the cons:-performance: even at the time of release, this device have a hopelessly underpowered cpu and gpu combination and only ~400mb of usable ram. it might not play some newer graphic intensive 3d games, however it does support many games. \"classic gaming\" is where its at for this device.-low brightness: the lcd display have accurate color, but is not very bright so can be hard to see under sunlight.-will eventually get dirt underneath the screen because it\\'s not properly sealed, unless you\\'re a very clean and careful person.-camera\\'s microphone: as mentioned, the camera microphone\\'s volume is extremely low, so recorded videos will be very quiet.-small gamepad: not a real con, but the gamepad of this device is a bit small so people with large hands might get cramps. i found the \"touchpad joysticks\" difficult to use.overall: even if you don\\'t intend to use this as a phone, it makes a very good portable music and gaming device, especially if you are a fan of classic consoles. it take decent photos and have good gps signal.note: i killed this device by installing a \"wet-applied screen protector\", which caused the phone to short out, the digitizer stopped working and other components messing up. so i recommend to be careful with water/moisture and don\\'t use wet screen protectors with this.also read my comment on this review for more tips. it cant keep a charge i don\\'t have much to say about this product thats already been said over and over all reviews that its a very elegant and very modern and very much a phone that all phone users should have and experience..........very nice and i do mean it phone don\\'t work on cdma network so plz don\\'t buy it super long battery life, clean live sound from speakers, easy to use display and on-screen keyboard. letter recognition works. cons: no real keyboard. muy bien best phone i have every owned. according with the seller description ok for all you people out there that buy phones that say they are \"unlocked\" and will work on any network, do not believe it! this phone said it was capable with any network, but then i finally get it (9 days late) and take it to the verizon store, only to find out that i have completely wasted my time and my money! it only works with at&t, and t-mobile, both of which suck for many reasons! everything looks great for this phone. incoming call quality and loud speaker is too low even after i set the call volume to maximum and phone getting warm while speaking.asus should take this seriously to improve the call volume and speaker for incoming. this is the basic and most usage feature of phone. the phone is good i think it is very good cell phone.... i can use it for every thing…. it is a complet phone…. this product is not an unlocked cell phone. i tried 3 different carriers and none of them could be recognized by this cell phone. i finally had to go back to my old phone and service. to make matters worse they are refusing to refund my money. excelente this phone overheats very rapidly when you have a case on it. i had to take the case off in order to use it. also, i have had to remove the simm card several times to reset the phone. i contacted my carrier and it is not a carrier issue. i think it is do to the over-heating issue. excellent. the phone works well. item as described. works well as unlocked phone. just inserted sim card and transferred numbers and it was ready for use. received a used phone with over seven hundred hours of talk time on it. was suppose to receive a new phone, not a used one. this worked flawlessly to replace my my son\\'s broken cell phone. we just switched the sim card and it was that simple. the camera quality is great which is an asset for me when purchasing a new phone. user interface is excellent and the phone very elegantly designed. it comes with a screen protector already on plus an extra. there\\'s also a pair of earphones included in the box which gives good sound quality.pros: great camera 8mp, easy to use and understand, lots of cool features eg. guest modecons: sound quality is great but too low. the phone is not very loud when ringing or playing music. i would give it 5 stars if the phone was louder this phone was ok at first but it keeps freezing and restarting. i\\'ve only had it for about 3 days now. haven\\'t downloaded anything or added any service yet. its just factory mess up\\'s causing it to have issues i guess. still not happy about this though. have issues with calls dropping and screen freezing along with staying in 4g lite. i have my samsung note for work so i know that it is available. it destroyed my 64gig sd card where i had my pictures and music saved. i bought 2 of these phones with the assumption that i would have lollipop by now. by the time that happens it will probably more version after marshmallow. called customer service and the are clueless on if/when it will upgrade. come to think of it my sd card bit craps that next day(something to ponder). received a shotty battery with device. amazon was perfect. the phone however has very poor performance i loved this phone when i first received but as days went by it was just to hot for me to keep holding this device to my ear. after a while the phone started shutting off during my calls the battery life sucks and it just wasn\\'t right for me overall beautiful pics it takes. as described. works great. awesome unique ui. good condition and clean esn. you don\\'t need to blow money on an m8 yet either. htc upgraded the sense ui and you still can use google now. battery life not great, so i bought a second battery from the get go. works great! never had any issues so far. i don\\'t like it .it is not functioning right great phone at a great price good good quality... screen resolution isnt the best but is def in all ways better than the iphone this phone is really cool. the back cover was easy to take off. it charged in about 6 hours. i put a metropcs sim in the bottom metal tray and somehow it managed to stick in there and is impossible to get out. then i went to tmobile and got the 25 dollar talk/text plan. i put that sim card in the top tray. then when i went to make calls it would ask me if i wanted to call from sim 1 or sim 2. to avoid having to make the choice every time i was able to go into settings and deactivate sim 1. i loaded some mp3 music on there and it sounds great on my afternoon run. it only took a 16 gig card. 32 gig wouldn\\'t accept. call quality through the headset is ok. my boss called me and it sounded like she fell down a well. it kinda diffused the \"importance\" of the call and made her sound kind of comical. the fm radio is killer and i have been listening to classical for a couple hours with no drop on the battery. there is a small learning curve on navigating the phones menus. i am happy with the phone and so far it is 17 bucks well spent. nice dumbphone for those who are looking to take a break from a smartphonepros battery life, mp3 player, fm radio, car game, ok camera, nice screen, snazzy look(retro), cheap, headphone jack works greatcons working through the menus can be tedious but once you get the hang of it its easy, dubious call quality husband loves it ... when i received this in the mail after ordering, i couldn\\'t have been happier. the color was vibrant, the case fit snug and secure, and it bore the lifeproof logo so i was content. until 2 weeks later. the cover that covers the charger port is extremely snug and after 2 weeks of opening and closing it to charge it every night, it gave and broke off. i\\'ve gone through two cases and they have both done the same thing. i didn\\'t want to keep having to replace my case every 2 weeks so i ordered something else and returned it for a refund. i am way too busy to be waiting on phone cases. other than that, the case seems great tho. after researching phones, i decided that this would be a good first phone for my young son. it was easy to set up and he is enjoying many of the features. fantastic phone. i am loving it. it has amazing battery life! 👌 the phone looks and functions fine with us phone carriers. the box the phone came in looked old and opened but the phone looked new but was the southeast asian model. the charging adapters are made for southeast asia. cool so i received my new phone about 2 days and a half ago and honestly its just what i was looking for i don\\'t know why some people even complain about it for the price you pay you have nothing to complain about seriously although i had a little complication with the sim card cause it didn\\'t register my previous one i was using for straight talk so i had to buy a new sim and activated it through the phone it was easy although the internet didn\\'t want to work but i didn\\'t give up on it i ended up just calling my phone provider again and they fixed the problem so far its really fast much faster than my previous phone i was a galaxy user just gave it to my mom and the camera is nice good quality for what you pay for i\\'m happy with my purchase no regretsps i never give reviews on anything but thought this should help cause i was really iffy about it at first as well so far so good with the fall bought for my 88 year old mother. all others had failed, but finally found one she can use. the emergency button is cheaper than life alert so that is a big plus. she loves it and a relief for me that she has a phone with her that she can see and use. highly recommend for the elderly. peace of mind for sure. the system was supposed to be new but looked as if it had been refurbished. i just pulled the battery and put it in the old system. the battery is working about as good as the one i pulled from my old one. this is me is kind of suspicious. great phone fast deivery i dnt have a problem i actually love it but they lie about the warrant and that was the main reason to get this phone because of the warrant the phone works very well. it is fast and responsive but the main problem is phone is taking very long time to charge but gets discharged very quickly even if you don\\'t use he phone which concerns me, thanks. 👍just connect the phone but a good show phone i have been used for 2 weeks so far so good but the interchangeable wall plug does not work! the battery is better than my nexus 4 but the processor speed is slower than nexus 4. the product arrived and was in the condition that i expected. the shopping experience was smooth and without difficulty. i looks like a big deal. it has good specs. however, it is the worst phone i ever had. i complete regret of have had this phone.first of al, it reboots by itself. i could have it in my pocket, for example, and it suddenly died/reboots without no reason. another example could be when i accidentally dropped it, and/or it receives a little hit.secondly, the bluetooth, 2g and 3g are pathetic. i always have problems with the connections. for instance, when i try to connect it to my car\\'s bluetooth, it is a pain in the neck(a problem that doesn\\'t happens with my friend\\'s phones in the same car).in conclusion, i won\\'t buy any thl product again. i\\'ll buy real enterprises\\' phones such as sony, apple, or samsung because i\\'ve never had this issues with any of them. i hope that you found this useful. it\\'s okay the phone is very good expect for its volume.its low i absolutely love my blu vivo 5. it is everything i need in a cell phone and more!!! just what i needed. .it\\'s working perfectly fine. .great phone...i will definitely recommend it. really great product. the camera quality is awesome. works in brazil. really beautiful. this item had no iphone in box box was resealed with some weird black tape only had ear buds and charger in box and box was in japanese horrible fraud i\\'m currently overseas, and at&t was giving me a hard time for unlocking my phone. i purchase this because i didnt want to carry two phones. it works great with my beat wireless headphones. ita a little bulky however, it get the job done. if you are looking for something to wow you then this is not your product. it simple and reasonale to make calls. works with sim card only. sorry verizon users. great phone. very basic but excellent choice for a grandpa or grandma. it\\'s okay. the app is crap. i can\\'t figure out how to get the sms to work. calls work fine. i\\'m still trying to figure some of the features out. you just get what you pay for. i love this phone i put my cricket sim card in i love it only thing is you have to call the cricket so they can walk you thru setting up the apn on it so u can get your pic messaging or go into the store and have them do it for perfect..!! my mom loved this and she is not tech savvy! i received this phone, use it for 1 week and the key is not working, particularly the return key just not working. i even reset the phone to factory reset, not working, no choice but return for refund. haven\\'t used it yet but seemed to work fine but when you get it its in chinese and its real hard turning it american lol /its nice but the voice is very low and when i did figure the internet out i never used it cause all the pages turn chinese to so i really dont reccommend it it . i bought this product thinking that it was an original phonestarted having problems with the phone with connections and found out that the phone is a fake samsungi bought it thinking that it was an authentic samsung. ordered my phone after looking at for a couple days,am very impressed by the quality of the phone, arrived on time and am loving it didn\\'t expect to just a phone, nothing else. phone had a scratch which wasn\\'t mentioned in description and i had to purchase charger and usb. awesome smart phone. runs lightning quick, surprisingly durable, looks decent and best of all tons of memory and no pre-loaded garbage or restrictions. best phone ever very nice if they would have sent a charging cable with the phone they would have got stars. the phone was useless until we got a charging cord. i\\'m so surprise about this phone...great quality! in cheap price! happy happy the only cons is the long wait to be shipped.but its worth! excelente compra todo en perfecto estado sin problemas recomendados 100 porciento ninguna queja buen trato bueno en todo sin novedad i love it i was forced into getting a smart phone because my carrier was retiring 2g services. i didn\\'t want to pay $700 for a new phone, so i found this one online. i love the look and feel. i\\'m still learning about all the features but so far i\\'ve been able to customize it to my liking. samsung has a website that offers tutorials and videos. very easy to follow. if you have a question, you can chat with a live person and get it resolved. good!!! ordered this phone for i wanted an android with old school virtual keyboard feel. it proves to be an expensive paperweight.. it\\'s hard to access the keyboard, ( could use some wd-40) and phone crashes after minimal use. i used it for two month before giving up on it.. not recommended this crap does not have wifi ... hehe! that\\'s terrible for anyone these days. i\\'m not aware of that before buying, so i give it one star only because it is mandatory.do not ever drive with! works awesome with straightalk i still can\\'t use my i put my gsm card in and all i get is network not registered tried doing everything to get it to work and still cant recomendado 100 % excelente producto, rapida entrega y embalaje, estoy muy contenta por haber realizado esta compra a amazon, los felicito por su atención, gracias this is a compact, easy to use phone that does what it is supposed to. the sound quality is good, & it is attractive. i love this phone the feel of it the weight and the size. nice phone, but the camera has poor pic quality everything was great and smooth until it got hard bricked.the screen is black (it\\'s shut down i guess) and it doesn\\'t respond to any button i press. excellent product. it\\'s just user friendly, i hate electronics that are like algebra great phone so far!responsive with no visible lag, fingerprint reader is reliable (100% recognition so far!), and sound seems fairly clear. camera starts up quick, but i haven\\'t really pushed the camera through its paces. the wife adores it, and plays pokemon go non-stop with no stuttering, lag, or overheating so far.will update after more use! wish i could leave 20 stars! i was run over by a 5000 lb truck with my phone in my pocket inside this case! i now have a broken pelvis, tail bone, and left leg! my galaxy s5 survived without a scratch! above and beyond our expectations! thanks a million!!!! very good great. really smooth os, overall i\\'m happy with it. it\\'s definitely not the most powerful phone on the market right now but for the price point it is excellent. great phone, long battery life. it is easy to brush the edge of the screen and cause some random swipes. battery also heats up with heavy use. camera is pretty good, but zooming it, you can see some fuzz. bloatware is minimal, and can be disabled. some nice asus features added. there is a bluelight filter setting, one handed operation to shrink screen to one side, autostart manager, boost program to close background programs.it\\'s very fast iwth 3gb ram and 32gb (25gb effective) storage, supports microsd. indeed has laser focusing, and can be used with an app to measure distances up to 50cm away. comes with android lollipop 5.0.2. make sure to look for a ze550kl compatible case. wont work with the zenfone 2 ze550ml case. its a nice phone.handy and practical for messages.good product compared to the price.it\\'s easy to use and allows internet surfing. we bought this watch 2 months ago and it already works no longer... very disappointed and my daughter too!!! the phone is a really awesome phone it works for every sim, and for the price you can\\'t beat it. the sound is a little low when you talk on it but that\\'s the only problem i have had with it after a day my phone would not register that the battery was charged. i can\\'t stand not knowing if the device is 2hrs away from running out of power or 20hrs away from running out of power. the windows mobile features worked but the call volume was so low that even on speaker phone a person\\'s voice could not be heard in anything but a quiet room. the keyboard and large screen are great but overall this phone is to big not to get in your way.(its slightly bigger than a ds lite) this product being returned. the phone was a christmas gift for my daughter and it said it was sprint ready, which is my cell phone carrier. so, on christmas day, i planned to have the phone activated so she could enjoy her gift. what i discovered was that the phone did not come with a sim card. so, i had to go to a special, sprint manufacturer store, get the card (which was free from sprint), have it installed and activated at the store. if the advertisement said it didn\\'t come with a sim card, i sure missed it! that was a pain in the butt and disappointing for my daughter on christmas. other than that, the phone works great and as always, amazon did a great job getting the phone delivered. thanks for the great service amazon!! excelente this was the best buy for my situation, did not want to give my current phone carrier. they were able to activate this iphone with no problems. thank you. i am very pleased with my galaxy note 3. this is my first smartphone and it\\'s awesome. my son has one that he paid a small fortune for. he was shocked that i found the g n 3 for such a good price. and it was delivered at the exact time amazon said i would receive it. was working great and setup on pageplus was a snap. i went through the setup of my accounts and other personalizations when it asked me to update the software. great! the device did its thing and was updated. a few hours later, another software update was needed, downloaded....and then the device goes into a black screen with tiny white lettering and an error message. unable to recover from that. attempted to do some research on online forums and it seems it is a consistent problems with that version of the software update for android on the droid 2. was able to return with not much fuss. i think i\\'ll steer clear of the droid 2 from now on. it is a very nice phone, and the very first phone from all the chinese ones i\\'ve tried which connects to 4g lte at&t band in boston. reception is not bad either, i have marginal one at home and this phone keeps up with iphone or galaxy note.it is a joy to hold, it has leather (i guess fake) back which fills very good in a hand. camera is ok, a little trouble focusing but maybe i have not used to it yet.the reason for 3 stars is that it shut down/crashes several times a day. i\\'ve sent for replacement, i will update the review depending on how the second one behaves.update: got the second one. good news: did not crash during two days i\\'ve been using it. bad news: camera is unusable. it was not that good in the first phone - it was hunting for focus, which was especially noticeable while filming videos. but in the new one it is totally bonked - it fills like focusing motor is rusty - it always slowly hunts for focus and frequently does not find it.so, if you do not care about camera and willing to take chances for $70 (i bought it on sale) you get a chance for a modern phone with good reception. great phone! i ordered this phone for a present. the phone is just as described and works great! the phone does not have spanish language installed, only english but it was easy to install from the rim web site. love the phone and got a great price for it. good for anyone who\\'s looking for a nice cheap and useful smartphone for everyday use. using for the tmobile line. works great excellent bad hasta ahora que el equipo esta acorde a mis expectativas; ha funcionado perfecto desde que lo recibí y he podido cargar sus paquetes sin ningún inconveniente aquí en venezuela con la linea movilnet! nice watch charges in 20 min . headphones suck get the adapter . but i got it working with my chromecast as a remote :-d gave this phone as a christmas present to my daughter. three days ago the keyboard on the lock screen disappeared. have tried a soft reset and a factor reset with no success. it is exactly 30 days past the window to return it, so feeling a bit disappointed! i purchased this phone for my mom who doesn\\'t like touchscreen phones and she absolutely loves it!! shipping was extra fast and it was in perfect condition!! great purchase:) i did a lot of research on this phone and thought i would take a chance. i am so glad i did, this phone is terrific, i couldn\\'t be happier..i have also got a lot of complements on it, i would and have recommended this phone to everyone. great phone! down side is a phone with 8gb is obsolete. learned this the hard way. i\\'m an android guy but daughter likes apple along with the rest of the brainwashed kids. spend the money for more memory if iphone is a must. it was nearly impossible to open the battery compartment. the plastic cover broke in the process. i charged it and installed a sim card, yet the phone didn\\'t work. after several efforts, i got frustrated and simply abandoned it. this product is not dual sim do not buy it has a dummy space that is cover but does not work nice phone is not compatible with anything. had to return. it works well and the battery last a long time. it is uncomfortable to talk on for very long it\\'s a $20.00 phone i love amazon but i bought 2 it said it was sprint compatible after a month. i tried everthing. i feel like i am going to have a stroke also now i cannot return or exchange them . a total disgrace the greatness of this otterbox was no surprise to me. its cheap insurance for your phone. i know its saved my several times. i like it :-) it satisfies all my expectations and it has lot of useful features that make me love this phone. it only has minimum errors that occur almost never. like the phone but sprint said it would not exept their sem cards and was not a sprint compatable phone. as the seller boasted it was. didn\\'t perform well!! it\\'s the wrong one,it\\'s too big. - works with straight talk.- lte, 4g, 3g, etc all work just fine.- ships with windows 8.0- can be updated to 8.1 for free.- cortana personal assistant is part of 8.1i use the straight talk at&t sim card, and it works great. there seems to be confusion reg excellent works great.. highly recommend i really really reaalllly wanted to love this phone. i am a phone geek... i love smartphones since i buy them, test them and sell them back eventually (if i so desire). thorough research was done before i purchased this particular model since i have recently decided to delve into the budget phone market and choose blu as the guinea pig. after purchasing the blu studio energy & the blu win hd (two amazing phones), i decided to try the blu studio 6.0 lte. why? because i love big screen phones and wanted a cheaper t-mobile lte alternative (this phone has all the bands to support t-mobile).let me start with what i love about this phone... the screen is gorgeous... amazingly crisp and bright. some would say the phone is laggy... but it was surprisingly zippy considering the specs are low. the camera seem to take decent photos also... all this i tested in less than a week.now for the bad... android 4.4.3... not a bad version but just bad on this phone. i can\\'t even get a percentage meter in the notification bar for my battery. ok... so i decided not to nitpick with that one and went on to test other things... like a new clock widget. i tried the htc sense clock from the google play store and it doesn\\'t work.... that was strike 2. the i decided to try my moto 360 smartwatch with this phone... it paired ok but the motorola connect app just would not work. thought it was a blu thing so i tried the moto 360 on the blu studio energy... it worked perfectly (i suspect it may be the android version since the energy has 4.4.4. while the studio lte had 4.4.3). throughout all this testing, i realized the google play services keep crashing which rendered the phone unusable.i had to restart several times to get it to stop but the last straw was ... my t-mobile connection kept fluctuating and whenever it does work, i only get edge speeds. tried the sim in my blu studio energy and got 4g.i was hoping i could love this phone... but with the inconsistent connectivity, buggy software and incompatibility (somewhat) with my moto 360.... i will have to return this product. good afternoon , this cell i arrived damaged me , no lights phone started out great, i loved it. and i still do, when it works. past couple days it has been restarting itself out of nowhere and when i try to turn it back on, it wont even come all the way on. it flashes the at&t logo then turns off again. really frustrating when i\\'m in the middle of something. this item arrived perfectly fine, on time and it looked great on the outside but the part where it charges the phone was old, moldy and burnt, and there is no way to fix it. i wasted $250. it\\'s a good phone,but the camera it\\'s all of that this phone is a very nice size. easy to start up just insert the sim card and turn on. my problem is the phone is very slow. i bought this for my husband he likes it. it is a good phone for a beginner. i also bought a phone for myself and returned it after several weeks. i could not handle the slow processing speed. when i returned the phone the seller credited my account as soon as ups scanned the package in. excellent customer service. cute but difficult to use. it came without instructions. most standard phones in this country use the same functionality, not this one. once you figure it out it works well. great hardware. the build quality of the nokia is unparalleled. having said that, i have to admit that the phone fails completely when it comes to software. i\\'m returning my phone since basic capabilities are turning into nightmares. hopefully microsoft should come up with a solution to this excellent piece of hardware. wish that it would take a 64 gb sd card i love this phone. i don\\'t have anything negative to say. perfect and fast shipping i always liked sony ericsson cellphones, but i am amazed by this one. the display is beautiful, the sound is great, it\\'s fast, and i\\'ve been using it for a month now and haven\\'t had any problem.i would definitely recommend this cellphone! so much faster than my iphone 4s.everything came in the box... iphone, charging cable and plug, verizon sim card, earplugs. i took it to verizon to switch over to my new iphone 5s but the rep in the store told me that i could have done the setup at home. :) i lke this product muy buen producto, excelente vendedor, entrega rapida y efectiva, me llego en excelente condiciones, agradecido por tan buen servicio prestado purchased this as a temporary phone for my husband after his other cell phone broke. he really likes this phone and we can\\'t believe the quality for the price. he has only been using it a few days, but he has been able to download his favorite apps, watch videos, and take good pictures. it arrived already charged and included all the accessories one would need to get started. the headphones, case, and screen protector were a great added addition! first phone was new but didn\\'t work propery. replace with used phone works great. secon phone apeared new just not in box. needed to get a new sim card from at&t but so much better than the s3 i purchased this for my trip to visit my family in the united states. this phone worked great with a great battery life. it was a tad bit on the slow side sometimes when navigating different applications. but for the price, i was not faltered by it at all. i used a \"straight talk\" sim card and it worked flawlessly with quick 4 g speeds. no complaints. after to put the phone in a water test, my phone was damaged because the water entered inside anyway.... now the phone is totally death and is just a plastic piece of 500 usd. sony told me that i can not claim the waranty, i feel completly cheated with this phone by sony, i never ever will buy a sony phone anymore. great product. my aunt loves it. great for older folks. i had the plan phone from att and loved it, but out of no where the phone refused to take a charge. i then purchased the unlocked version and found nothing but trouble. the charger that came with it did not work, the main language was in korean out of the box, the system was out of date for a month despite updating every hour for a month on its own, and the icing on the cake was the screen shattering after falling no more than twelve inches to the ground.i wish the first one i purchased would have just kept working, but that\\'s life. now i\\'ll try my hands at an entirely different windows phone.oh, and the only charger that will work with this is phone is a single one...the chargers that have a separate plug and cord do not work. much better quality than the 720p version but had a real hard time getting it onto wifi. had to direct connection then teach it the network. i thought the screen was bigger on the classic brought this for my son for christmas, he hasn\\'t complained once. so i guess its a great smart phone, all the features of my galaxy note, he is watching netflix and everything with no problem. great inexpensive phone with all the functionality of an expensive phone. excellent 4th generation galaxy. this phone is a piece of crap. yes its a older unlocked refurbished phone but it should at least do what it says it can. not happy at all with it. enable i hadn\\'t bought it. pretty much perfect, the only problem is the front camera quality isn\\'t that great. i love this phone!!!\"! iphone 6s pus that bought from amazon is awesome and as per expectation. very nice perfect. just as described. works on tracfone on verizon network. the phone was in good working condition and new. however, the entire manual was in spanish (which i do not know a word of). so i\\'ve had to ask friends who have the same phone for instructions or help in finding certain things in the phone. the phone was even in spanish, i had to select a bunch of options until i saw english...this sucks. works great looks brand new no issues would highly recommend this company to anyone i know i fell in love with this phone. i\\'m not a big phone person and don\\'t really care of having the latest technology or all that extra junk. just needed a phone that was simple,more updated then my last phone, good picture quality and could run fast as i do go on the internet a lot and use my email for a lot of important things. this phone tops it all its super fast and i never knew how great an unlocked phone could be because my tmoblie service works great! came in great condition and delivery was great and fast. best decision i ever made with buying the perfect phone made for me! i love it so much thank you amazon and open group wireless! excellent job :) it is perfect... this iphone was in very good shape....works fine...and unlocked...gracias... works great was not in the system and could not be activated very few directions came with it and they were very poorly translated from chinese to english. i was forced to return it. too bad, it seemed like a nice little phone. absolutely love this phone. i\\'ve had no problems since purchasing it, more than 6 months ago. it really is a beautifully made phone. i bought the gold version and still love it. the speed of this phone is unmatched to the numerous other androids i have had. highly recommend. damaged and would stick. could not use but i returned it thanks i had no battery samsung but a nokia and comes without headphones. i am very disappointed. would not recommend. no guarantee because they do not provide good service. i bought it for christmas and so far i have no complaints i love it bnib quick delivery - highly recommend. it came with scratches and dents on three of its edges.and the worst part is the so-called refurbished phone did 382 battery cycles!the seller is called \"mywit\" nice phone but doesn\\'t work with virgin mobile or cricket only certain carriers so be careful when purchasing this is an excellent phone considering the price and the fact that i got mine as a refurbished piece. quick, responsive, and can be used with straight talk or net10. excelente servicioexcelente producto con todas mis expectativas no puedo pedir mas y el servicio demaciado bueno gracias muchas gracias cool i bought this phone in 2012 nd it got stolen that same year. but i loved it. i got a iphone now after one month, a chip on the logic board failed which controlled recharging the battery. not repairable. had to purchase a new phone. i could have exchanged the phone with apple for ver5, but chose to upgrade to 6s and get a new phone. stunning camera! best phone out there, battery lasts 40 percent more than z5 faster, better. the only downside, is that no small apps again. the fingerprint sensor works only with uk firmware.doesn\\'t bring any headphones the reception is fantastic. great as described this phone is tough it can take an abuse everything i expected i\\'m impressed. it is a great phone to have. thin and light and full of wonderful features. tech support is a little slow in responding to my question but the it does not detract from the phone itself. now if blu can update it to the latest android operating system, i\\'ll give it 6 stars. good phone but overheating the battery is too short the net work don\\'t on it without wfi i\\'m not enjoying it i think i want to send it back i like it unfortunately the herd mentality tends to support apple\\'s product thus there are fewer applications for this great, and in my opinion superior, smartphone. totally love this phone. it\\'s a little bigger than i wanted to have to carry but on the other hand i like the big screen. serious bang for the buck. so far i can\\'t find a thing i don\\'t like. one if best on market honestly better than iphone or galaxy pretty fast on straight talk works great for bring ur own phone deal. great services strong singnal where some phones wnt have service im honestly staying with the rarz line if ur an andriod person then this phones for you. goog value for mony, great support from the seller i am tired of gettint these surveys,,,, pls go away works good. updated review. purchased this phone on november 27, 2015. worked great for 5 months. it started to not keep track of time last week. now it doesn\\'t charge. i do not recommend this phone or brand. stay away, far away!!!!! works as expected. i returned this device because it was larger that i expected. so far so good. i would recommend very happy at this price point. there are definitely better phones out there, but this one offers a lot of bang for your buck. it performs well and didn\\'t come with too much bloatware. i have been through two other phones with net10 and this phone kept me with the service. the quality of the phone and the \"verizon\" cdma towers it uses in my area make it seem like i\\'m using contract phone service with net10 prepay. phone call quality is very clear and i have service in areas i didn\\'t have with my previous verizon wireless contract phone. after using this phone for less than 3 months. it\\'s plagued by a host of ills. battery charge and charge indicator is epileptic (i\\'ve had the batteries go from 100% to 0% in a minute). phone randomly goes off in at random battery levels even at 42% charge. and phone exhibits ghost screen effect randomly.i regret buying this product and it\\'s certainly not worth buying. the only reason it\\'s getting one star is because i cannot give zero star. everything went great. phone was in great shape and works perfectly. i love my phone works perfectly not one problem. bought this phone on september 7 2015 and my screen was damaged i did not drop the phone or anything i turned it on and the screen looks dim from the bottom and lightly dimmmed on top and the screen looks blurry didn\\'t even last a whole two months. it has an awesome display, excellent battery life and a nice performance.pros:-excellent build quality.-clear, bright, with nice blacks screen.-awesome software performance.-with apps like camera360 the camera really stands out.-front flash works nice.-the fingerprint reader is really fast.-dual-sim-expandable storage-quick charging, well, quickly charge the phone.cons:-because of the full hd screen, 3d gaming is not good, i mean games like asphalt 8 will run at around 25fps in low settings. but its fine for a 200$ smartphone :doverall i\\'m pleased with the phone and i highly recommend it.overall i really like it and i highly recommend it- i wanted a cheap fitness tracker with clock.the bad: the pedometer said unavailable, the sleep tracker said unavailable, and i could only find the sedentary alert once- don\\'t know if that worked.the middle: the band on it is huge. i\\'m a big girl that usually uses extra links in a watch, and i was on the second to last hole here. it\\'s thicker and heavier than i expected, but i think i would get used to it.the good: even though i didn\\'t want to connect it to my phone, it connected easily to my iphone 6. i could get my music, even though it wasn\\'t very loud. i liked the idea of an fm radio. even though the headphones didn\\'t fit, good sound quality. when i received the package i was really excited. when opening it up i got a $100 gift certificate for wine, xsmall iphone charger and a mismatched wall plug. regardless of all of that, i was so happy to see how well kept the iphone 5c was. as i go to register/swap out the devices it was taking way longer than usual, and the sprint consultant told me it would still be a 42-72 hour wait, to hear back from the it department. apparently the phone wasn\\'t working with the network or with my annual contract . i\\'ll wait and see what happens with their it guys, then if needed send it back. great seller. very good item description including photos of actual phone being purchased. kudos! keep up the great work. wonderful! cool looking! sort of art deco. bought it for my mom for its elegance and eas of use. she\\'s a nanogenarian. the product itself is good however the companion app that runs with it is not up to par. the companion app continues to crash and keeps wanting to update after running updates the companion app then continues to crash more conductivity between the device and my smart phone is non-existent. the device in and of itself is very nice and functions very well however the device is practically useless to me without the necessary companion app. excellent love it! the speakers are so good i heard voices in the video and thought they were behind me it kinda scared me considering i was alone at my house. great looking phone, almost new looking. it came wih a funky charger tho, maybe european?? thankfully i had another regular american charger. like it for the price. however, i could not get multiple clock faces and the gold finish is flacking after a few months. i have the previous vertion and i bought this one to have more capacity downloading social apps, but it clashes like the other telephone.in which i could only use whatsapp. now i have whatsapp and instagram and that\\'s it. it does not accept another one like twitter or bb pin or line. this product is not of the best quality. it didn\\'t last for a long time before it started going bonkers. i have since tossed it in the trash. i hope receive, just once, tomorrow august 25 or friday august 26, thanks. phones were refurbished when they supposed to be new and was not able to received and send calls. worst of all i had already send them oversee and could not returned them. this phone is amazing. it runs smoothly and takes stunning pictures with its 8.0 mega-pixel camera. the battery life isn\\'t great. also, you have to use the headphones that come with it or it will (even on its lowest setting) destroy your eardrums. the basic design of the phone is nice and i love the screen\\'s clarity. if you are considering buying this phone, invest in a case for it as well. the screen is not fragile but since it\\'s so big it\\'s better to be safe than sorry. over all i would definitely recommend this phone to persons of all ages. great product and value excelente bought this for my husband. he does love it, however it drains his phone too much and too fast. awesome phone my son love it he can get all his school work in it thanks i am an american consumer and was excited to replace my blackberry relatively cheaply. when i first received the package i was surprised that the box was entirely in spanish and for movistar (spanish/latin american carrier). the seal was broken, the phone was dirty, there was no memory card. instructions were only in spanish. even the charger plug is european style, not american--i.e. you would need a *converter* to plug it in to an outlet here!! how ridiculous. the version from excell should be advertised as a phone for european and latin american consumers only, it is not appropriate for use in usa. great phone for the money! the battery was defective. no question about it, this phone is amazing for the price. my only problem is the camera, but it can be experimented with to produce good shots. battery life is great for a heavy user like me, and it works great with t-mobile. the ram surprisingly does make a small difference. i had 35 apps open and was switching between them rather fast, and it did not lag at all. overall, the price cannot be beaten this smartphone i really like it. the features are awesome.most of all the price was reasonable. great phone no problems so far. bought this phone to use on vacation and i tested it at home first to check battery life and overall condition of the phone. it has been perfect. the battery lasts a long time and the phone is reliable. i know i made the right choice to use as my local phone when i am in a different country. great phone for a great price !!! love the features on this new system. great to have an iphone again. i dont think they are overated like everyone says. i think that andriod id full of too many advertisments and seems kinda unsafe when downloading programs. looks brand new and was better than described. arrived early! this company was pleasing to work with. loved the look and how the phone functioned the 2 min i got with it. unfortuanetly we realized we bought a phone that didn\\'t work with the service provider. i recomend you call your service and make sure they will work 100%. not all gsm phones will work with the service plans. i would buy this phone in the future as long as my service provider accepts them perfect! product as described, immediate shipping! this is an excellent phone, is truly awesome, but.... i bought this phone (international version) from this seller fgs, brown and everything, the only problem i got, was that the international version results to be indian version, that means, it has only 1 language english (india), android allowed me to install an application to change the language, however, some text still appears in english, i think it should be explicit in this publication.beside that language problem, the phone is outstanding, i\\'m truly happy with its performance and capacity, the battery \"drain problem\" is fixed with juice defender application, therefor, i think is excellent and you should buy it with eyes closed.i rated with 4 stars because i kindda feel this is a \"tricky\" publication. not too happy with what this phone has to offer. performance is good. variety not do good very good very good phone super cool, excellent for texting, not too big and not too small, it\\'s just right!!! item delivered on time as expected. great deal. the sprint phone is easy to use, quite sturdy, and offers 3g\\'s. i have bought before this one had a few small issues such as the \"p\" button not working when upright, but it is still worth the cost to me and beats the heck out of att. great so far received the watch however so disappointed it doesn\\'t work.i don\\'t. know if i want to return it for another....may get another bad watch.put the sim card in.nothing.message screen continues to flash and can not navigate.what a waste bueno i got my son and my self this modle different colors and we both love them. about to order my mom one. its a great phone for the price!!! u wont be sorry.. its been a month since we have been using them on straight talk unlimited plan...uses 4g fast!! very nice case. good good phone at a great value. works perfect on t-mo with new nano sim installed at store. ~$30 charge at t-mo store for new sim installed and activated. needs nano sim and type c charging cable. charger comes with type c to type c ~1.5 ft/.5m cable that cannot be used for data connection on computer with standard type a usb plug. plan on additional cable & charger purchase and check amperage rating on charger. smart charger with amp detection or smart usb charge station recommended. good the description does not state the screen size for this version is 5.2 inches and will not fit in any of the 5.5 inch cases sold in the usa. do not buy this. no way to find a 5.2 case in us. dimension information is missing for most cases even if it states it fits your model phone. no way to call a vendor to get info before purchase of a case. not good if you think you might drop your phone. ever. it doesn\\'t play videos got it on the next day! looks and feel brand new. its good for the price and a starter watch. worked great until the new lollipop update now cant get any notifications because the bt notification software will not work on lollipop. 7 months with this phone. i love everything about it. if there was one criticism i didn\\'t like about it was the music player. but google music makes that a negligible issue for me. i had an iphone 5 got messed up, and needed a temporary replacement. bought this one, never went back to the iphone. i\\'ve dropped this over dozens of times (don\\'t even use a cover) and not a scratch. love it even doh the phone does not have a slot for memory card the performance of the phone is great. excellent pic\\'s when using it and also excellent video at 720p great felling in the hand for use and fit properly i took delivery of this phone in sept 2015. this product was advertised as a 4g phone but actually operates only on edge. very disappointed with the product. better than, what i thought i really can\\'t see the everyday benefits to using this phone over another. i\\'d recommend a blu studio 5, lg v 10 or other lg. i\\'ve used the 3, 4, and 5 from friends and my own order and i always have issues or parts issues.the phone i got was supposedly gold, which i paid extra for but it looks reflective silver.the front camera had a red hue and i reset all settings with no change. back camera has blue hue from time to time and will not focus, not good for micro/macro focus shots.the battery drained 25% in 30min with 1 3rd app installed and no background processes other than the ones i can\\'t turn off from samsung running or tabs open.it overheated like crazy during charging, it was just sitting there with the cord that came with with it and i was worried i\\'d have to pull the battery out of the phone... but the back case didn\\'t come off. huge drawback.i couldn\\'t tell if these issues were \"normal\" but it made my phone impossible to use. side note, after i added my email to the phone my account was attempted hacked over 20 times in one day. somehow since i constantly change my password and don\\'t give out my email... i don\\'t think it\\'s a coincidence... i feel it transmitted data for feedback but my email got sent to whet it was visible by others.pros for this phone, it\\'s very thin, but weighs little so it\\'s easy to lose grip. screen looks great. can apply themes/skins that are cute. has nfc technology. phone is great works fine it\\'s brand new just wish it came with headphones but it\\'s all good i am very pleased with my purchase of the iphone 5s wife love her phone exactly what was described! great buy! i was dissapointed with the fact that the original box was opened when i got it ( i guess they updated the software ). other then that, the phone works great. no problems with it so far. floating touching screen and the nfc technique are so cool! i love its appearance so much! but the only pity is that it cant be changed the bettery. delivered in time and phone condition was as described. this watch met all of my expectations. i love ... it worked perfect in venezuela . it was the perfect phone to replace my old 4s... i recommend it, thank you very much great the phone got so hot it melted!!!!!! this phone is amazing and i bought this phone without no problem and i am very happy for amazon.com and lg g3 . i am sugguesting everybody get this phone quickly you have feel better and better thank you amazon thank you lg :) i love my sony xperia z5 compact!! it\\'s comparable in size to the iphone 5c just right for me and having an amazing sound and picture quality is a huge bonus!!!! this is a good to great phone. its depends on your user level.i bought it because i was traveling abroad and needed a gsm phone that i could use in that country for people to call me locally and still have access to my regular phone. the reason i gave it a range is that for me, it seem a bit slow, given that i use a much faster phone on a regular basis.but this one served its purpose.i would recommend this phone for anyone travelling abroad and wants a local number. love this model - first one had a software problem, but seller accepted a return easily too,. i\\'ve been using the phone for two weeks, until now everithing is ok. the phone is easy to use, intuitive and fast.you can find lots of apps for everithing, and they work fine.the only things that i don\\'t like are the battery and the lack of an included micro sd card. i have to charge the phone twice a day if i use normally on internet and etc.. i hoped that for the price the phone include a micro sd but it doesn\\'t.so i recomend the phone, it will do almost everithing that you need. don\\'t waste your money on expensive phones just for the brand. phone received was stolen, t-mobile couldn\\'t activate it. i sent it back with a prepaid label provided by bastex that did not even cover the cost of sending it back, i paid an extra 8$ to send back this stolen phone. i was ultimately refunded minus the extra 8$ to ship it. also just received an email from bastex asking me to remove this review..why would i do that it is a completely accurate account of what happened..too funny. this phone is amazing. on the other hand, this seller isn\\'t. after 8 months of proper use, my imei number dissapeared, when i dial *#06# the reply is \"null\". i have not rooted the phone. i can still use normal features, except i dont get signal, i\\'ve changed sim cards, mine works in another phone, and others sims dont work in my phone. there is a red \\'x\\' above my signal bars. i sent a mail for help to the provider but no reply. i send a return request to the provider and amazon replied: \"reason for the closure of your request: expiration of returns period. seller comments: <none>\"i mean, i\\'ve tried normal reset, hard reset and even downgrading firmware to stock, problem hasn\\'t been fixed, not even a year has passed and i\\'m gonna have to change phone to some used one that a friend doesnt want no more. amazing phone... straight out of the box at to work it went. couldn\\'t ask for a better phone.. i like this phone because it is so easy to text on, since that\\'s all my kids and grandkids do to keep in touch. this is my second pantech phone, it\\'s about as close to a smartphone you can get without being one with all the hassles they have. my only gripe is that the battery life isn\\'t very long if you talk on it very long. could not get phone activated on page plus came with wrong battery this phone did not work! 50% of calls were either dropped or wouldn\\'t go through. i can\\'t return because window has been closed. apple won\\'t replace because i didn\\'t purchase from them. i\\'m out $300. i recommend you do not buy! meets my expectations surely this is a great phone. i still feel the 640 is the best value, but with the 950 you get windows 10 from the starting gate, and dont have to fight through an upgrade process than can be quite cumbersome. also, you get a better camera and hardware improvements. for me, i dont use the phone in such a way as to notice the hd camera or really test the limits of the hardware...the main function that makes this phone better in my view is the visual voicemail...i cannot stand having to listen to all the voicemails i have until i get to the one i want to hear.both the 950 and 640 have numerous cheaply priced cases that work perfectly...one thing i do not miss about the iphone is the cost of an otterbox!as someone who is familiar with android and ios, and someone who has owned/used many iphones from the 3 to the 6plus, i can tell you that windows 10 phones are much better than the nay-sayers are admitting...there are a lot of apps available for them as well.i will tell you that there are less stupid apps available...if you are a twelve year old girl like my daughter you may find less ways to waste your time in the ms widnows app store...but as for real apps that actually do something productive and useful, i am lacking nothing switching from apple to windows. thank you about iphone i love it !!! after just 3 days it was here, everything works excellent and i\\'m just in love with my new iphone !! great phone, other than the fact the memory doesn\\'t allow you to add additional memory, although there\\'s space on the phone i cant keep much apps. excellent just what i needed to replace phone that was dropped in water. insurance wanted to give me a refurbished white for the same amount of money. nobody buy this phone it is the worst phone in the world and it turns off and wont turn back on. great product.... awesome phone delivered before time item is good, a touchscreen. words are so tiny, i\\'m having difficulty punching in numbers. sometimes the stylus pen won\\'t, when typing in english, it becomes difficult 1. because the words are tiny. 2. the wordings appears in other languages & trying to make it appear in english is very hectic. 3. would prefer bluetooth instead of the earpiece, it makes it dangerous to use in other countries. the watch should be able to bend. i bought this phone because i always wanted a razor and i really like flip phones. not big on touch screens. and the razr is just one of the coolest designed flip phones. i had to have it. the phone came on time and was well package. the reason i gave it a 2 was because of these reasons. the side buttons for volume and voice record are very loose. almost feels like they are going to come off. the cover over the front screen on the outside was coming unglued. the battery cover had dents in it already. and the keys are also coming unglued. gluing the cover and keys back is not a big issue. but this phone was supposed to be brand new. it was more in used condition. the biggest problem right now is the screen will go black and not come back on. i\\'ve only have used this phone for a total of 3 weeks. i have to take out the battery and restart it all over again. and the screen doesn\\'t always come back on. takes a few tries. it was working good until this. if it didn\\'t have all these issues i would have gave it a 5 star rating. so if you want one of these phones be careful when you buy them. your taking a risk. you may or may not get a new one. fantastic phone for the price. very good i love my new phone and it works real good. my only complaint is why does it have to be so big. by the time you add protectice screen and case thu phone is like a small tablet and quite heavy. the cell phone was in very good conditions. it works fine. i am impressed by the overall feel of this phone. it is well made and feels sturdy. the phone is fast and exciting to use. i had it up and on my carrier within minutes of inserting the sim card. i am very impressed. i have not recevied my blackberry now have i received any information on it! disappointed. extremely. yet my money was taken of great experience. as expected. excellent you know, i was very skeptical of getting a used iphone on amazon.i wasn\\'t sure about anything when buying this phone. it was sold by a seller named \\'k&k realty\\' and had no other descriptors other than that the phone was in \"very good\" condition. i needed a phone pretty quickly, so i chose it based on the fact that it was prime eligible and the seller had ~90% positive rating. i took my chances.well, the phone came in great condition. hardly any scratches. the iphone met the expectations of the sellers \"very good\" condition it was stated to be in. i hurried towards a corporate verizon store (corporate stores won\\'t charge for sim cards) and had them transfer my account info and number over to the iphone. it took about 10 minutes.overall, i am happy with my purchase, even though i was skeptical at first. i had no problems with anything. bien this is the first smartphone that i have owned and so far i like it. even though this is my first smartphone i still know how to use it because of owning a couple of tablets. this phone seems to run smoothly and starts up fast. i like that it has a finger print scanner that you can use it to lock your phone. as far as the specs for this phone goes it seems to be a good deal for it\\'s price. i also like some of the things that moto did with this as far as the hand gestures that allow you to go straight to something without unlocking and searching for them. such as making somewhat of a chopping action with it in hand will turn on the flash light, which is bright, and twisting your wrist quickly will open up the camera. the version of android that this came with is very basic so you don\\'t need to be worried about there being a bunch of bloatware on it to slow it down or waste space. as far as cell phone networks go this is one of the few unlocked phones that i have seen that will work with just about any network provider. i use att which i read a couple of reviews where people had issues getting their lte to work but i didn\\'t have an issue with this at all. i went to an att store to get my sim card though. the size of the phone isn\\'t that bad to me either it\\'s a little bit bigger that my flip phone was but not near as thick thankfully. the screen is bright even on a low setting so far i haven\\'t had a bright sunny day to see how well it works in direct sunlight. the camera\\'s take great pictures too. the sound is plenty loud enough but don\\'t expect a stereo effect from this phone since it only has the one speaker which is fine with me. charging on this phone is extremely fast only takes about an hour and a half to charge to 100%. one thing i\\'ll need to keep my eye on though is that it seems to get a little warm while charging. other than that this phones seems to work great.i mainly bought this phone because i was looking for a good budget phone and this one caught my eye along with a couple others but i ended up going with this one because of research and readying good reviews. i\\'ll update my review if anything happens that would cause me to change my opinion on this phone.my advice though if your looking for a good budget phone and one that leaves you with a good amount of options in cell service providers than this is the phone you\\'ve been looking for. 30 days after our 2-year verizon contract was up, i threw my old note 3 about 8-feet into the air and it landed on concrete. bad day. didn\\'t want to get into another 2-year contract and i loved the note 3, so came looking for this unit.looks and acts brand new! moved the sim and sd card from the old to the new and it started pulling my apps back down to the new device. it did take about 90 minutes to download and install all of the android updates. honestly, for all i know this device was never owned by anyone and was liquidated from some cell phone retailer who went out of business.packaging was good, but not retail. the charger and cable are not usb 3.0 items that would come with a new note 3, but they are serviceable. i still have what came with my original note 3.there aren\\'t any features on the note 4 or note 5 that made me want to invest in them and i like that all of my old accessories (extended battery, sound dock, spare pens) are still useful to me.no regrets! this is a great phone. i did not want an iphone 6, so i chose the 5s. my only complaintis (and the only reason why i did not give it 5 stars) is that the battery is short lived. to methat is annoying especially when i have not used it that much and the battery is down to75 or 80%. so i have to charge it frequently. if anyone has a hint for me to increasebattery life, i\\'d love to hear it. its a junk.im trying to dial and it keeps on typing numbers cant stop it. when sim card was placed in the phone it fried every sim card that was placed in the phone works with ringplus, get sprint sim simglw236c from best buy for $5.built in texting app won\\'t send mms texts on ringplus. workaround is to use 3rd party text app like textra sms, then mms texts work fine. i was hoping it would work with my ipad. it will not. this team will not buy it for my nephew, is no international version, is at & t, normal rest. i have not used but my nephew is doing very well with it. also i think the team is not completely new. by entering the battery cover will damage one of the fasteners, and with the backing to buy him and he realizes that. it has a small manufacturing defect where you enter the sim, has a protruding plastic to be lifted in order to enter it. great seller.fast shipping don\\'t buy this item. to my fellow t mobile and huawei mate 7 users - i come bearing gifts! finally after calling t mobile and writing to the seller i was able to find a fix for my 1 and only gripe i had with this amazing diamond in the rough!i. got. the. mms. to. work!here is how.1. go to setting. mobile data. access point names. there will be two fields. tmobile data and t mobile mms.2. go to tmobile mms on and under the mmsc field select and copy the entire string of text.3. go to the t-mobile data apn and here paste the string you copied in the mmsc field.4. under the apn type field you should see default,supl,hipri. what you need to do is add ,mms to it. you should see this string default,supl,hipri,mms5. make sure you save your changes to the apis so that they take effect (duh) =]my theory is that huawei is actually super efficient and it doesn\\'t require 2 apis - one for data and 1 for mms but since most us phones do that\\'s the info t-mobile is sending you here.and there you go. now you have mms working. enjoy! please rate this review if it helped you so that other people could see it as well! i was pretty bummed when i saw that my mms wasn\\'t working but now i\\'m quite content with everything this phone has to offer! i\\'ll attach images as well for ease of use! byeee! very android - after using samsung tablet, lessons learned were transferrable to phone. would have preferred clean international version, not at&t, not t-mobile or any other carrier\\'s version. firm believer in buying unlocked phones that are in no way tied to any carrier. great item excelente producto. the phone works fine but wont hold charge the battery drain very fast, i fully charged night before in the morning the battery only has%30 .it has also over heat problem. i wiil buy again bought this as a gift for the husband - he loved it. using it on t-mobile. no issues. battery life is very decent. the phone comes with gps/nfc on by default. please turn them off and battery life will improve. phone will perform some system updates upon startup - pls let it do so. build is very high quality. i dont understand when users say there is nothing new in this phone.. it makes calls, it has a very good camera, runs all the apps...best of all has a form-factor that is fits human hands (one of the key reason i bought it). i got it just a few days ago..very satisfied so far..update: wifi reception is less robust than my prior samsung phone. this issue appears to be more pronounced when both bluetooth and wifi are on at the same time. brilliant! just the thing for a fella who needs something durable, relatively simple and affordable. perfect excellent i am truly fasinited with my new toy. it doesn\\'t look like the clumsy phones that many of my friends have but i\\'m still discovering new things that it can doeveryone says it\\'s a good buy. the camera is a lot more than i expected. my daughter loves this phone. good iphone awesome this phone is refurbished. so it works great so far (had it for a week). i just wished the listing would have stated that it was refurbished. this my second moto x.this one did not come in the factory original box and and came with a weird charger - the charger works but not as well as my original one. also, it does not, again doesn\\'t come with the sim card tool that my factory original did. my son was pleased with his gift. great phone and absolutely love its performance. worked fine with rogers canada carrier. excelente excelente product thank you very much i enjoy the fingerprint addition so when people are nearby i can just touch the home button to unlock my phone without anyone lurking to see me enter my unlock code. the speaker has a problem i think i cannot give this phone high enough praise. it is a beautifully designed device, easily handles even the most demanding apps, and has more features than i will ever use. the reduced touchwiz interface is a joy to use, and greatly improved over previous versions. i can say without a doubt this is my favorite phone i\\'ve ever owned.i do want to note that this is an international version. as such i was surprised, though i shouldn\\'t have been, to discover upon opening that i\\'d received the italian version of it. this means the manual and the wall charger are both the italian versions, too. the seller was kind enough to include an eu to north american adapter so i can plug it in. initial setup was a breeze, with language selection being one of the first screens upon powering it up. the utilities folder was still named instrumenti, but aside from that localization switched entirely to english without any problems. i read a different review that said they got the french version, so it seems there\\'s no way to know what you\\'ll get until you get it. i still think it\\'s an excellent product and well worth carrying an adapter around with me since my carrier doesn\\'t sell the s6 yet.five stars! i will wear it as a watch and nothing else. i cant answer calls with it even when connected to bluetooth. i really wanted this product to work as the specs seem to be a good contender against samsung galaxy s series. it has everything you can wish for a smartphone but the hardware has serious issues. the unit i receive keeps on getting unresponsive from sleep mode after about 20 to 30 minutes of sleep. pressing the power button will not wake it up. suggestions regarding pressing the vol+ and power button didn\\'t help. it seems like it just crashed while in sleep mode so the only recourse is open the back panel which holds the sim and sd card and press the reset button for several seconds till it vibrates and restarts. i\\'ve tried upgrading the firmware to different versions (4.2.2, 4.3, 4.4) to no avail. i ended up returning it after two days of battling the issue. the placement of the protruding power button on the side is also a very bad placement if you are using a holster case as the side of any holster case will tend to press the power button. it never turned on. when i turned to the blu customer support, they wanted me to return the item to them, with me paying shipping, and use the warranty to have the phone fixed. i\\'m sorry, but if something never worked in the first place, it is not a warranty issue. if they would\\'ve shipped me a new phone and had me ship this back, i probably would\\'ve kept it. since that didn\\'t happen, they lost a customer. wonderful phone. the cellphone did not work. the scream was damaged. it looked like used love the phone. works great! would give it 5 stars but didn\\'t come with original box and no accessories as described when i first bought it i bought the wrong version when i was supposed to get the 3 but then decided to just go with it. it was good at first and i loved the apps but then as weeks go by and the phone is downloading more apps, it starts to freeze alot, not a lot of memory and its terrible at camera quality. if you use a lot of social media, suggest getting a much better phone to keep like the lg 9 or samsung galaxy3 or 4 just as described fast shipping thank you i had it for 2 weeks and now its broken can i request another one out of my warranty worth the value. superb features. item is as described, still working on learning how to use it. it is a wondefull phone in all sense. i am glad that i \\'d choose this phone hello, this came to me as i expected perfect recommend this item and this shop. will apologize for my english is not good digitizer broke in my pocket. i weigh 140 lbs with a case on the phone. substandard construction makes it too flexible. tech supports says i can\\'t even have it fixed by the manufacturer. this phone didnt last a good 6mo beforebitvwent out!!but was still under warranty so got a replacement!!my husband has one he got his from sprint haven\\'t had any problems with his!!!but over all its a great phone!!he\\'s very rough with phones and its still working even with the type of work he does!!!i guess its just not such a goid idea to purchase phones on these sites!!!! way better than my samsung phone the merchandise is taking too long a month and is much more a1++++++++++++ it\\'s actually a pretty good phone for the money.upsides - simple, functional, sound quality was good on calls. pretty cool that it takes a 64gb microsd card.downsides - difficult to root, battery life isn\\'t great (but you\\'d expect that from a smaller battery), the microusb port got loose after a few months making it difficult to charge. difficult to complain when it\\'s under $20. only negative is dropping the connection inside some buildings in nyc on t-mobile network which doesn\\'t happen on my smartphone so it sounds like it\\'s the phone not the carrier. when you\\'re outside its fine. gave this to my middle school kid for their 1st phone i\\'m very happy with the purchase! the phone works perfectly, and as i expected. my one small complain is that the top part of the screen kinda edge out of its case, so i occasionally have to push it back in so it\\'s snug. it doesn\\'t come out but starts to edge out, which i\\'m guessing is because the screen was once replaced. i\\'ve replaced a screen in the past and the same thing would happen because some of the glue and snuggness of everything is lost when parts are changed. in any case, its not enough to bother me and i\\'ve got a good case for it, so i\\'m looking forward to lots of time with this phone. for the price it\\'s excellent. i bought this phone and sent it to jamaica. in less than a month the phone wouldn\\'t turn on. the phone sweat underneath the memory card and damaged the circuit board. this product is not in good, slow and very fragile pin battery, has no spare parts.do not throw your money. ordered the us version of this unlocked phone as i am moving to uganda africa. product arrived in designated time frame, but box was somewhat damaged...as if it was partially opened on one side. when i opened it, i think i know why. there was an english abbreviated instruction book in the box, but that is all that was in english. the phone was in a language i could not at all understand (portuguese maybe...just not sure). i tried to look on-line for a manual to try and change the settings, but since i could not read the screens...it was to no avail.i immediately called amazon customer service. they were extremely helpful and sent me a return label immediately. i returned to phone the same day, and am awaiting my refund. i ordered the same phone from a different dealer that day also, and to my relief, it is in english, and am hopeful it will work when i get to africa and obtain my sim card. thank you amazon for your help with the return.... first time i have ever had a problem with anything for you. i bought it as a gift it is going out of the country nice phone, i didn\\'t check when it arrived and i send them to india .one is working fine but other is asking for pin number .not able to use that phone.what to do. works awesome! huge antennae, no tv reception anywhere that i took it.as a cellphone it worked flawlessly while traveling overseas with fantastic battery life. even though the phone was advertised as unlocked, it was not unlocked. the phone came with an at&t sim and worked fine the first time i turned it on. however, when i used my t-mobile sim it kept saying \"invalid sim\". i tried it two other gsm sim from a different country too. if you are buying it to use with any other carrier than at&t please dont buy. with amazon\\'s great customer service policy, i was able to return it. but doesnt worth all the hassle the screen size is very nice. i wish they made a $300 version for adults. this phone is lacking the guts for adult every day life. great phone for the kids tho. i have suffered with battery shortage since i start to use smartphones years ago, now this huawei mate 2 let me use it for 5 days+ in a single full charge, the quality of the phone is very good as i have been using it for 7 weeks now and it is only $299, for me the battery life is the 1st thing for considering to buy a smartphone, if you have a one of the top smartphone on the market but do not have enough battery to use it, it is just a joke, isn\\'t it? love it!! this phone freezes and get hot and this was supposed to be a new. i have to pull the battery out to make it work. it is a cheat.the cell is used, even not refurbished.the back cover is broken. a corner lost.the battery compartment is full of dust.i can\\'t beleive that happend in amazon. have been burned before with another company on a different phone. had to send back. not this one. great phone, great price, great fast service. color is a bit more feminine than i thought, but it works well in brazil. very good item works perfectly fine had it for a while now and no problems have occured. great seller and fast shipping this phone is the right size and as is fast!! it was purchased for my son\\'s birthday. he is happy with this phone. my son prefers the smaller phones and this works for him as some larger ones like the iphone 6 and 7 are too big for his taste. i will never own a phone without an otterbox defender series again after 2 years my previous phone looks brand new and the only reason i had to buy this one was because i got a new phone i love my otter boxes omg all perfect nice color good size but too basic doesnt hold memory what so ever and its not loud enough .. phone pretty much is good for nothing too slow i love this phone! i am super clumsy with electronics so i couldn\\'t justify spending much money on something i would likely break. i\\'ve had it for about four months and i have no complaints! great job i just bought this phone for my daughter and she loves it. the only issue i had is her old phone had a mini sim and this one takes a larger version. so instead of waiting to order a sim adapter (since att and bestbuy both told me they couldn\\'t help me) i took the matter into my own hands. what i figured out is the sim 1 goes in the top slot and a tray is below it for sim 2. so i then side my sim card in the first slot with the sim chip facing down, then to hold it in place i put a piece of scotch tape over it. once you put the battery in the sim is snug in place.i have a blu vivo air which i love but i have to say for the price this phone is really great. i could have down way worse for the same price. great phone sound is low quality and the speaker is in the back which is the main reason why i am returning it a few hours after i received it. my old samsung s3 has much superior sound and the speaker is in the front where it needs to be.the unit came with a tiny instruction booklet that is essentially worthless. it took me a while to figure out how to open the damn thing just to insert the sim. great when the phone stopped charging i went to check the serial number in the sim tray. for my surprise the sim tray did not have any serial number as is should.then i checked the sn on the box that came with the phone. i went to the apple site to check the warranty and got the following message?\"we\\'re sorry, but this is a serial number for a product that has been replaced. please check your information and re-enter your serial number. if your information is correct, you may need to contact us.\"after that i went to check the backup of it on my computer and discovered that the serial number did not match with the one on the box and worse than that the apple site tells me that there is no more warranty for this serial number.now, i have a new iphone that does not work and does not have warranty. if i have to pay the 150 dolars to have it fixed, it means that i could have bougth a iphone 4s instead.this is the first time i have problems whe buying on amazon. i hope there is a way to solve this situation. whenever i take/place a call, the incoming/outgoing call voice has a low background noise. but if i switch over that same call to speaker option i wont hear any disturbance. only few complains about battery life from the user after 2 months this phone stopped reading any sim card we used. would not recommed gerat love this case! it does have the hole for the home button. and fits my se perfectly. it also fits the 5s as i tried it on that phone also. the color is beautiful and not super bright. otterbox defender is the only case i\\'ve used for my phones and when i recently upgraded to the se i didn\\'t want to get anything else. but many of the colors i found were 25-40$ and i couldn\\'t believe it when this popped up for such a lower price. i purchased this case and the orange and green real tree for another phone we have. both came in original otterbox packaging and arrived quickly. i\\'m very happy we got these and their lower price is awesome. compared to my original defender case these are the same quality. great works perfectly fine and in good condition its awesome smarthphone, light weight, very thin, fast and good resolution of its screen and camera. q maravilla d telf item arrived safely and on time.it was very impressive. one of the speakers is broken from water damage, i learned cause i got it with a broken screen also and when i went to get it fixed they told me why complete waste. it did work ,i gave it too my nefphue instead of making it mine . it will be used indeed . i don\\'t see them often so he jumped on ithope he will enjoy it as much as i . item has a known defect in which sim card 2 stops working which is why there is no warranty. seller refused to cross ship and wanted to leave me without a phone waiting to replace this one which really wont do much good as its a known issue with the lt10 model. ok dear seller,i received my phone without earphone and i have serious battery problem. it losing power quickly. excelente it fullfills all my need great buy except for short battery life buen vendedor lo recomiendo, estoy 100% satisfecho con mi articulo el articulo es como el descrito por el vendedor gracias received my phone today sooner than expected. love everything about it. should have gotten lg sooner. bye samsung.... i bought in april at $215. i used to be owner of low-end pantech burst to high-end oneplus one (opo) device until i broke it. i knew this phone is outdated by 2 years but here is my thought: comparing to new mid-range phones are currently offering, this device is still a beast!* pros and impression:- good specs- small bezels- 5.2 inches is great size, fit well in my pockets. unlike the 5.5 inches opo- bottom speakers- all high-end, neat features included (quickremote!, double tap, nfc, miracast,...)- great camera with optical image stabilization!- unique design with all buttons on the back*cons and suggestion:- plastic, slippery material for the back. get a case, i suggest diztronic tpu.- do not buy screen protector, none will fit neatly since there is a slight curve on the sides.- ugly default launcher ^_^ install new one. i\\'m using dodol launcher if you wonder.- bloatware from at&t. go to settings and disable them.- no expandable storage, no removable batteryin conclusion, i don\\'t think any sub $250 phone in us can beat this. i just hope the carriers will keep updating android versions. if this helps, you\\'re welcome. great phone thank you phone was no good after about 4 months of use. i am so sorry i bought this phone. i would prefer to give zero stars to this sh!t. i bought this unlocked phone for my husband for his birthday and he loves it. it has great features and is very user friendly. sometimes the touch screen doesn\\'t respond on the first tap, but it is not a huge problem and is probably no worse than any other touch screen phone. also, since it is a european phone, we couldn\\'t find accessories, such as a silicone case, that are made specifically for it. other than these minor things, i would highly recommend this product! at this poinlt i would give no stars if it was an option. well the first phone i purchased kept resetting itself, and doing a bunch of other crazy stuff. so i returned it and purchased another one hoping the first one was just a dud. unfortunately the second one is doing the exact same thing. i really need a phone. and don\\'t really want to keep going days at a time without a phone to fix the problem. guessing i need to take my money else were, since for some reason it won\\'t let me send a message to the seller.... this phone is great and battery autonomy is gorgeous.thank you guys! my husband is using this phone outside of the us and it works great! picture quality very nice! i purchased this for my daughter and she is very happy with it as she travels around england taking great pics and sending them back home to us. easy to switch out sim cards for international phone service as well. i wanted &:searched fox an unlocked phone. this phone was not unlocked. it was carried through a company called\"great calls\" and did not provide service in our area. the entire transaction was a nightmare and had to be unwound. we never were able to use the phone. when i ask for an unlocked phone i expect to be told that i am not receiving what i asked for. not pleased at all, phone suckz i got it with a bad battery it even had the purple xxx on it aux cable hole plays music with a scratchy noise can\\'t even get my money back because i used it waste of money and time if u don\\'t get this phone because my review yourwelcome mobile phone appearance at a line still, there is a slight scratches, can accept, but found that the battery is charging when use more than 300 times, for it is not satisfied nice. ok for the price. ok very good ,as with the new machine! good poor quality control. it was wiped, but was still registered to the prior owner. i contacted the seller (breed), and they would not replace for another unit. i would not trust this seller. gracias muy bueno the only problem i had is the screen had a blemish line, but it\\'s a used phone. other than that no complaints. very good phone i love my note 2...my second one...it does everything.... note 5-6 cost big $you can buy a refurbished note 2 for less than $200 and it won\\'t effect your plan per month like adding a store phone for $30 month for 2 years! decent phone, not a terrible price. it\\'s obviously the first in the series, so there are flaws, but i knew that going into it. i do not chase phone. i love this phone very much especially for the price. this phone has all features that i need; it fits in my pocket with its small size - works great and so was the price. did not work at all. we got two of these from different sellers. shipping took about 8days and the first one worked great! my bf loves it its one that came in white mine is the \"blue\" more of a teal which i like but the screen sometimes won\\'t come on when i push the side button i have to take out the battery. and my screen freezes a lot but my bf\\'s works 100% great. don\\'t know what went wrong with mine but i\\'d still buy again. although unlocked it works only with usa. does not work in asia do not order this phone as it does not work with verizon. i\\'ve spent more on it support and working with verizonvto try and get my phone working, i wish i would have just bought a phone through verizon! phone will not email more than one person at a time, phone will not show if you have missed calls or messages, phone will not sync with outlook calendar! greetingi am writing to inform you that the phone galaxy sm- g800h i received is not dual sim, and i have accomplished in various page and this galaxy s5 mini model is dual sim.i want to know that you can do for me. because the phone does not work for what i buy . and on another chace he had ship this model and dual sim.thank first, the description says n910a (at&t version) but actually what shipped was the n910t (t-mobile version). that being said, i\\'m using it on at&t so the bands are 100% compliant with at&t\\'s network (i get full lte speeds), and the upside is that the n910t ships with an unlocked bootloader (for those interested in rooting and that sort of thing). i\\'m quite pleased with my mistake, because after some research the n910t is definitely the phone i should have been looking for.i cannot speak highly enough of the condition of the phone. i\\'m picky and i cannot tell it has ever been used. i feel like either the screen was protected by a screen protector or was entirely replaced; either way i cannot distinguish it from a new phone. there is not a scratch, smudge, or crack to be found.the product shipped in a non-oem box with an oem charger/usb cord and white apple-looking headphones. i\\'m not sure if normally more tips are included for the s-pen, but i only got the tip that came in the pen. all accessories also appeared brand new wrapped in plastic.i see some complaints of bloatware, which are valid (t-mobile bloatware in my case) but it doesn\\'t take much to go through and disable those apps. sd card support means i\\'m not worried about storage space; i have a 64gb card and most of my storage-hogging apps (i.e. kindle and zinio) are able to be moved to the sd card.update: this phone is still awesome. i recommend getting a samsung microsd card if you find yourself interested in the expandable storage, as i initially used a sandisk and had lots of issues with the card unmounting and apps moved to the sd not working. i read up on some android forums and saw some people had issues with non-samsung cards (don\\'t ask why). i switched to\\xa0samsung 64gb evo class 10 micro sdxc card with adapter up to 48/mb/s (mb-mp64da/am)\\xa0and have not had a single issue in about 4-5 months of use. okay i love the phone itself, but i hate that they tried to sell me a used one especially when it contains a multitude of sensitive personal information from the previous owner. epic fail blackberry, and you should probably notify you legal department that your technicians are not properly wiping the phones and that they are trying to sell used phones as new ones... anyway try again my hotspot never worked. and can\\'t update my cell 5.2 lollipop 2 sad totally satisfied with my order. the package arrived almost instantly and the product was up to my highest expectation. i am very glad to have such an amazing product as samsung galaxy note in addition to my other gadgets. the note is very handy while traveling by plane. not bulky and the screen wide enough to watch even movies. :) recommend! recommended seller. i loved my smart phone. thanks. ithis was one of the first phones that would access web easily but this one did not work has problems excellent, to date i can say it\\'s very good product. it\\'s a good product. i got it brand new. everything is fine except for the battery life but i can\\'t hate on it because thats how it is with any smart phone. other than that its a good phone and i recomend it! in an effort to better control monthly expenses, i switched to this net 10 phone. i have had two android based phones (2.2 and 2.3) and a couple of blackberries. this phone had great battery life and very good reception. it is very light and has a type of plastic on the sides that will prevent it from easily slipping out of your hand. the mp3 player is nice, but i haven\\'t found any equalizer settings...the sound is still good though. it isn\\'t a smart phone, but is is a great little text phone. the browser works for basic things, like a quick email check. the camera is fine for quick snap shots and seems to do pretty well in average indoor lighting. if you live in a cdma area with limited gsm service like i do, and you want to go the net10 route, this is a good phone, especially for the price! there is a newer version of this phone available for straight talk (r375c) that has better screen resolution and better web browser capabilities, but i haven\\'t seen it available for net10. for now, this phone is just fine. phone very good! it was great..a true find for the money.my son is truly happy with his gift. meets my every need i totally love it i love this phone...this is my second blu phone because i wanted to upgrade. the quality as well as the price is unbelievable. wish it came with a charger. item shape not to good ,but good enoth for collection this is replacing my galaxy s4 and lives up to the hype. no problems transferring phones with consumer cellular, i merely took the sim card from my s4 and put it into the s7 and i was ready to go, no hassle. battery life seems to be much better than the s4 plus i like the fingerprint log in although sometimes it won\\'t recognize it making it frustrating. i end up having to use the draw pattern. overall a nice phone. amazing phone! love it :-) easy to use. has a lot of apps, good display. i don\\'t much data so can\\'t tell you on that. battery doesn\\'t last long, lags a little. overall good phone i love it excellent smartphone wawww!!! great product. so beautiful the phone met & continues to both meet & exceed my expectations! it was a very easy set up and is faster and more intuitive than expected. i have been totally satisfied to this point and would definitely recommend this phone. my son\\'s phone was so old his work apps wouldn\\'t work on it any longer so he asked for a new phone for christmas. when i ordered this phone i expected it to take a week or more. but i think it showed up in 4 days. much faster than i expected. the phone was loaded and up and running in less than an hour. my son never wanted to get rid of his old phone - he was happy with it. but since he got this one he\\'s realized that he loves this one even more. newer and more features. i was just what we wanted. great shipping and a really good deal. i\\'d buy from them again. excelente i have read many reviews who h say that the phone gets a weaker signal than the at&t or the t-mobile version of the phone which s are me a little but i decided to buy the phone anyway. i got the phone and i compared it\\'s signal with my s6 edge at&t version and this international version did show less bars but i believe it\\'s because it\\'s programmed slightly differently but the strength of the signal is the same if not better. i noticed that is some places where my at&t version couldn\\'t load stuff because of a weak signal this international version loaded it my much better, also the phone came with the factory seal untouched, no fake one on top of it one of the biggest mistakes i did is to buy this phone on amazon. till date since buying the phone in early july i have not been able to place more than 5% of my calls and still have not received a single call on this phone. all the calls drop each and every time. and when i do receive a call not able to pick it up. the dialler functionality to receive calls is horrible. i tried calling motorolla for help regarding this issue and i was told to do a hard reset on the device which i did but the problem still persists.shame on motorolla and amazon to sell such horrible devices. i received this phone in excellent condition. i ordered. this for my daughter and she is very pleased amd excited. it was a perfect gift to someone. thank you yes i love it...works great ..is fast..gold is fancy! i\\'m still terrified to carry it without a case..but a clear one works fine very nice put the chip in, turned it on and it is done. it is running since then. no issues. the person i gave it i svery happy with the large keys. nice disposable phone for the price. very good, great phone! love this phone... it was everything i expected..the camera is nice and the battery is good... good good sell good iphone thankyou.......... good phone case is of poor quality. feels cheap and edges feel unfinished. mirror is faded, has scratches all over, and terrible in quality. the card door feels flimsy and like it will break if i open it too far. returning, not worth the money. i purchased this phone about a month ago for my wife. she has a samsung note 3 a flagship phone from 2013, which is still running perfectly fine, but decided to get this for her to test the world of unlocked phones. a couple of years ago the mid range phone market was non existent, fast forward to 2016 the selection can be mind boggling.this review will be a comparison between the two phones and her experience. btw my carrier is t-mobile and coincidentally they have refurbished note 3\\'s for $199.features/specs/performance:both have fairly large screens. the vivo 5 coming in at 5.5\" (720p) while the note 3 at 5.7\" (1080p) super amoled. looking at the screens side by side she says can\\'t really tell the difference in sharpness, both screens are vivid and vibrant with color. however, i vivo 5 does get a bit brighter. the note 3 has a stylus, while the vivo 5 doesn\\'t.both have 32gb of internal storage and 3gb of ram, the vivo has an 8 core mediatek processor vs the snapdragon 800.both running android lollipop (note 3 upgraded from kitkat) with their respective skins, i\\'m hoping blu keeps it\\'s promise of marshmallow. my wife grew accustomed to touchwiz, so i download touchwhiz apex launcher from google play to keep her android experience fairly the same.camera: both sport 13mp rear shooters, in good light both produce very nice images. i would give the edge to blu because of the software and options for full manual control. the front facing camera on the note 3 is 3mp while the vivo 5 has a 5mp, both are just good at best.performance: both performed equally well, both are very fluid, smooth and no lags at all. her daily tasks include...social media, phones calls, texts, google calendar, cozi, photo editing apps, web browser and online shopping. she also dabbles with video editing with an app called kinemaster and both phones handle hd video with ease.in conclusion, today the market is saturated with a ton mid range unlocked phones and the blu vivo 5 is this one of them. it\\'s aimed at users that do not need the top of the line specs and hardware but is still able to provide full functionality. would i recommend this phone to that type of user? absolutely! the phone does not work well. sometimes usable sometime not. the phone work ok. you have to press down hard to navigate through the icons. i bought it for my 10 yr old so it\\'s ok for a starter phone. i disliked this product because i bought this phone for my boyfriend. the day we received it, we turned the phone on and the screen was purple and black. you can\\'t see anything on the screen. can\\'t even see the screen to power it on and off. it was a waste of $312. great ! i\\'m heavily impressed with the speed and quality from the axon so far. not only does it outperform my previous lg g4 in antutu bench tests, but the overall interface feels unobtrusive, natural and true to android (where i\\'ve found lg\\'s to be a bit cumbersome). when i first held the device i felt it was a bit long, but i adjusted to the screen size surprisingly quickly. i\\'m also surprised at how much of a difference the 8mp front facing camera makes. as a casual snapchat user, i\\'ve actually had people ask me what phone i\\'m using for pictures.overall, i\\'m very happy with the device. looks like the g4 (which i paid much more for) is going to remain in the drawers. this phone is less than 2 months old and it has already died. it keep trying to open and cannot. it is very frustrating. it\\'s all i want... great.. and so beatiful.. a few weeks ago you buy this phone and everything is fine just the aux input does not work donot i can do not work for me since i bought. nothing to be excited about love it works great the phone is uesd good . it is not a new phone , the box`s seal not originally. and there is not black hard shell cover for me. i love it males phone calls on att 3 g network best phone it came broken had to get the camera fixed this is the right phone for me i have used htc phones for years. i love this phone. i didn\\'t get the m8 because i couldn\\'t afford it. it doesn\\'t matter to me because this one is still an upgrade from what i had. the phone was very easy to set up on straight talk. i love this phone and it\\'s so easy to set up your personal preferences. i was lost with the samsung 3 that i kept only for 2 months. no dan señales del estado de mi pedido, habra llegado??, ya me lo envian??... nada que puedo hacer respondan proveedor this is the first time i have used straight talk and it seems to be a good phone so far. i have no idea how to use the dual sim part of the phone. i like the phone. it was just what i was looking for in an upgrade. yet, i was disappointed to know that the reason why the image of the phone in the above photo does not show the front of the screen; because it\\'s actually an at&t phone! the at&t logo is on the front of the screen, and i was expecting to use the phone on verizon network. i went with another company besides att using a sims card since it needed one. disappointed that the seller didn\\'t specify these phones are programed by att and come in att boxes. fyi. but it does work with a sims card and i haven\\'t had any problems with it. thank the lord. softwere pesimo. i really like the iphone 5s, i can reach everything on the screen with my thumb. i am wondering about the future of apple since the death of steve jobs though. they are involved with dr dre now and i heard they are going to make bigger phones, something steve jobs was against. guess we will see. i am from venezuela, the phone is in excellent condition, is the best purchase i have made, arrived in perfect condition at the place of shipment, recommend we have 3 of these phones and we needed a replacement. we couldnt get it at the verizon store. amazon had it, we got it in 3 days i called verizon with the sn# put the battery in and it worked. it works on our existing plan no extra fees. it\\'s not a smart phone but its good for calling and texting good qwerty kybd it fits in your pocket and it\\'s durable. bought this phone on amazon as new and got this phone in open box (resealed), you can see sticker is tampered. its not brand new returning this product, this is the first had problem with amazon. the product was fine. it was the delivery people that messed things up. very nice man and really understanding. i checked in with t-mobile to make sure the problem is not the sim card. we put a new one, problem was not solved. then, we made sure the phone is unlocked. however, t-mobile was not able to help solving this problem with the connection/reception.i am not able to use this phone in the united states due to lock of connectivity. t-mobile advised me the phone must have a different frequence most likely for europe or asia. i am not happy with this purchase. very good i usually don\\'t complain if something isn\\'t too bad messed up, but this phone came with a really bad crack in the screen and a slight crack in the bottom. the back is also badly scrapped up! it didn\\'t even come with a charger! anybody know why the volume speaker icon blacks out as i try to touch it?.. if this isn\\'t annoying enough, poorly engineered volume control settings as i tried over a year how to fix this issue. every time i try touching the icon speaker to increase loud speaker,, the touchscreen goes black,, and i can\\'t seem to find anything in settings to fix the issue. think i may go back to the nokia ph.. sell this one here does not stay charged, shuts down unexpectedly at inopportune times. this iphone is not unlocked. just bought this product and it does not work with my carrier in brazil. what a shame! great value for the money. fast, clean and simple! phone did not work right and the seller took care of problem fast happy with result worked great thanks amazon when i first brought this phone i thought it was the perfect business phone. i have now had it for about 6 months now and i realize this phone isn\\'t all that it\\'s cracked up to be. it exits you out of apps radomly, sometimes apps freezes, in the age of technology where people use a lot of social media websites for business alll of the social media apps on here is limited and doesn\\'t run well all, trying to watch videos, seminars or anything can be a hastle when trying to fast forward it it exits you out a lot. sigh i loved it for the first 3 weeks but just like any other not so good relationship once it settled down on me it start showing me it\\'s true colors.but i do looooove the keyboard the size and the look of the phone. the image of blackberry screams out bussiness but the functions doesn\\'t. i used to want a blackberry soooo bad for the longest due to that thought and it was always my favorite phone but now after this because of the productivity of the phone i\\'m going to have to go else where to get a phone i would rather have an i phone and android now but i need something with a keyboard that\\'s bomb like this lol. it\\'s an iphone, what more does one need to say! i upgraded to the iphone 6 when it came out (i needed to test a few apps on the larger screen) and then last year i thought, \"if i get the plus, i can have an even better reading/watching experience\". after 6 months, i\\'m ditching my 6s+ and i\\'m loving this phone! it\\'s so small and light it almost feels like a toy, and i don\\'t need a case to keep from dropping it. i love it and the camera quality is great. horrible cell,no sale to enybody enymore good phone for an extra. love this iphone!! super fast shipping! 😊 excelente producto. near mint condition. better than was described. working great. liked the cell i arrived on time and in accordance with all its accessories, the software also had to program in spanish. this is a great phone. i had upgraded from the xperia tl and this phone screen is bigger and in my opinion runs faster and smoother. the phone is presently running on kit kat. only small issue is that it came with the language set on spanish out of the box. amazing phone to have. i love it. except for the battery drain issues wonderful for the price thanks good price i do not recommend this seller. the phone has problema since i bought it. when you make o receive calls the other person did not listen and now sometimes tve touch screen does not work well. i contact htc and they told me the problem os the phone. a-1! very nice. worked as advertised. full of features, you may want to carry an extra battery. wifi did not connect right out the box. never could get a picture text and now won\\'t work at all. wasted our money on this. awesome phone, mine came and there were no scratches on it and it was 100% fully functional. an ok cell phone for travelers. excellent item this phone is not good, started very good for some months and now is problem.wish if i could get a refund on this phone. everything is perfect! the phone is working fine,but the earphone and its accessary that came with the phone doesn\\'t seem to be original earphone, it looks chinese and the production is not good. love the droid mini and for the price from this seller, you cannot beat it! the specs are great, the phone size/weight is comfortable, and after being an android user that \"tried\" an iphone, i am super glad to be back to android.the seller shipped quickly, packaged the product well and it was as described! many thanks! very good service of amazon as well as the phone. thanks a lot. hello good morning my friends prompt delivery as promised so far so good this phone is huge! doesn\\'t fit in pocket and has poor instructions. (can\\'t figure out how to turn on the light).also, the phone won\\'t work with my sim card which works in other phones. this was a total waste of money for us. we can\\'t use it. really would like to post that while purchasing this phone i saw all the review that this phone will work out internationally and it\\'s unlocked.... but when i came to india this phone doesn\\'t work..... excellent phone fast, good responsive and features, 4 stars cause can be better in shape and weigth but es good for the price as good as new and i saved a bundle! this was advertised as unlocked, however, it is locked on at&t network. this is a terrible phone, both my children have one and they constantly have to reboot the phone i loved it! i only need this phone for my roaming sim card and i am very satisfied. 😍😍😍 i am not happy with the phone. i wish now that i had gotten the s7 instead. my son jumped in a pool with original phone, this was a replacement. phone in great condition and works great, not so much for the battery though! wouldn\\'t hold a charge. for such a low price i wasn\\'t expecting much, but much to my surprise this htc phone turned outto be a pleasant surprise. unfortunately, this cell phone is not the original at&t package. not the orange one, but a blue one with a samsung logo. the battery is empty, but is not new, produced in 2010. handset is new, but also not with original package.the phone have no scratch but smells bad, doesn\\'t have the new one\\'s taste. but it is unlocked and seems new. i\\'m a little bit confused why amazon sell the fake/renew one? how do you take control of the quality? so i give amazone.com a bad feedback! everything great good product great price fast shipping i dropped it on the floor and the phone broke not the case the phone what a poj one of the more current htc phones and it worked smoothly just as i expected will never buy anything again. i received it and did not work. neither one of them. then returned them both and they received it. never got my refund of 89.00 back, like they said it would happen. love this phone! and current price for this is almost a steal. ended up buying this for my wife and also my mom. i have had the phone for over 24 hours so far. great phone. good sound, good voice, fast o.s. good signal reception all around, though in n. nj that is not really a problem.i charged it initially at home with the included ac charger, and at the office hooked it up with the included usb cable and saw the phone charging while i was playing with it and synching up my calendar.i swapped my sim card from the old phone, (htc hermes/att 8525), to this one and it worked right away. att medianet needed no configuration even though i had only added data/texting to my account from online only minutes before. wifi works well in my home. this is my first time using att medianet so i can\\'t really comment, but it helped me compare prices on a microwave oven from inside a store. amazon got an order for a microwave once i got home and i saved over $50. it is nice not hunting for a wifi signal as i used to do. glad i finally succumbed to paying for att\\'s service. i am not comfortable with nokias included browser yet, but it seems to work well. i may try opera.i can work with office documents and synch up with my outlook calender faster than i could with my old htc/att win 6.1 smart phone. nokia pc suit is leagues ahead of ms active synch, and puts motorola\\'s software to the shame it deserves.folks that play with it are amazed at how fast the phone responds when selecting applications. instant response instead of a second or so wait as many windows based phones have.the one issue i have had is i can not get the included headset to work properly as a headset. i suspect it is intended as just a music headset, but no matter what i do i can not get loud enough sound out of it, and the manual has no mention of it other than showing where to plug it in. when you attach the headset the phone asks what you want to use it as. whether i select headset or headphones it does not seem to work well. the phone will warn you to use the phone mic. i recommend getting a better headset/headphones when you buy the phone, i am doing that right after i post this. maybe with more use i can sort it out. i only tested it by calling my office voice mail, since i did not want to annoy friends and family by making them guinea pigs.this brings up the 3.5 mm jack the phone has. i am often on support calls. sometimes for hours at a time. (yes, i am an i.t. peon). i did not consider this when thinking about the phone, but there are no standard headsets that use 3.5 jacks that i can find, they almost all use 2.5. the headsets that do use 3.5 are either iphone style earbuds, which i find very uncomfortable, or ones intended for pc gaming, which use two plugs and are not usable on a phone. not an over-the-ear one in the bunch. so i am stuck using bluetooth, which loses power fast and can\\'t last long anough, or getting a clunky adapter so i can use a standard 2.5 mm headset, or trying an iphone earbud style headset that has the microphone in the wire, not on a boom, which has poor voice quality compared to a boom and hurts my ears after a few minutes. slightly disappointing.i do like having the hidden qwerty keyboard, as i did with my prior phone, so that it is there when needed for documents, email, texting etc, but out of the way otherwise. someday i may try a tablet-style phone, like the e71 or a blackberry, but this works well for me.one big reason i got this phone is the number pad for dialing. while touch screens are nice, having them as the only interface to the phone is a mistake.if you need to dial a number fast, such as 911, it can be very tough to do. number pads are better, and if the primary use of the phone is as, well, a phone, it makes sense. it fits easily into my shirt pocket. i do not need to hang it on my belt and feel like batman as i would with a tablet pda.but touch screens are useful. i think this phone would benefit from one for navigating the menus, it would probably be faster than using the various keys. the screen could be larger, there would be room to extend it if nokia moved the logo from the top of the phone.there is a lot left to play with on this, like the multiple profiles, etc. so there is still more to learn on this.but all-in-all, even with the headset issue, this is the best phone i have had yet, whether smart-phone or not. if this is an indication of where nokia is going, they are going in the right direction. it\\'s been 3 days since i got it, screen already showing problems, don\\'t know if it\\'s factory defect or they drop it right before sending it to me.... i am going to return it before it gets worse people expecting a fire-breathing flagship killer for 50 bucks are likely to be disappointed, but for an essentially disposable phone with limited smart capabilities, it is fine. works well for actual phone calls, sms messaging and other communication tasks. ok for checking e-mail and limited casual browsing, but i am not in a hurry to try to use it to replace all of my other computing devices. \"4g\" hspa+ should be fast enough for the non-streaming-video crowd, and it addresses the major shortcoming of its predecessor, which was rather limited storage space (although a marshmallow upgrade would have taken care of that easier). an ideal phone to take on vacation, and if you accidentally drop it into a tourist attraction it won\\'t be the end of the world. travelers take note: worked well in every country in europe i\\'ve taken it to.for people who observe that the response can be a bit sluggish, you have to allow the phone to complete all of its start up tasks before diving in to do any serious stuff. i have a few apps that always start with the device, such as an anti-malware scan, and for the first few minutes it is noticeably crawling along. after that it seems to run just fine. and it probably helps to have smaller fingers - the screen is not exactly in the \"phablet\" size range. i\\'ve had the phone for one month and i\\'m already thinking new phone.what do i like:nice screen. size of phone. dual sim capabilities.what i don\\'t like:very little storage space. picture quality not good. now the phone freezes when i try to take a pic from the chat screen. i have to do a battery pull to get it to restart.seriously samsung i\\'m beginning to lose confidence in your manufacturing. very capable smartphone and faster than its rivals, smartphones with processor of 800 mhz doesn\\'t even come close in performance. didnt work to make or receive calls those one is good i bought it but it doesn\\'t work with the unlock smartphone i bought because the phone cannot be activated here in the us. screen went out in less than three hours of having it. wouldn\\'t recommend the product. phone was sold under verizon as the carrier. when i called verizon to activate the device they said the ime # was not a verizon phone and would not activate the phone. it is larger than i had expected but you get used to it. it is a little heavier than expected but it is a very solid feel to it. the battery life is shorter than expected but not a huge issue. the big screen is very easy on the eyes and the touch screen is very sensitive to the touch. the camera okay but has issues in low light, but any camera is only as good as the photographer using it. i\\'m as happy with my blu as i was with my old samsung. for the money, i will be replacing this blu with another blu when the time comes. works great! easy setup. low end product and appropriately noted as no warranty. i would not recommend this defective product as it is not supported by the seller. it\\'s all good the product exceeded my expectations! i will be using amazon a lot more often love the phone. simple, elegant and powerful. at half the price of an iphone it\\'s a great alternative and a good way of getting into our android without the bloat. no replaceable battery or memory add on makes for a compact phone. try it still has a decent screen size and your virtually guaranteed the latest updates when they arrive. i picked up the international version and i\\'m using at&t when in the us. i can only access 3g/hspa but that\\'s plenty quick for me and when i\\'m in europe i get all the frequencies. sweet handset, awesome price! nice. this phone has many issues. the wifi goes on and off constantly, the gps cannot locate or track, the battery dies very quickly, and it is very slow. had this phone for a few weeks and it is driving me crazy. i am ordering a new iphone 7... very nice phone, it works flawlessly so far. this item arrived defective me, and as it has lost money guarantee. i bought two (2) and with different vendors and both arrived damaged. i recommend not buy. it is a scam .. el equipo llego dañado ni prendia se supone que era nuevo y creo que era reconstruido bueno perdi el dinero good phone, minor scratches and dents but works perfect. excelente ended up trading this item for an item of far greater cost. the person to receive this item is ecstatic with it. excellent for the value, wish it had a camera butother than that, wish instruction for we chat were in english not chinese so i can\\'t use it if we\\'re in en it would be a five. it\\'s by no means water resistant not even from light rain. this phone was my first smart phone, and every time i smash mine, drop it in boiling water, or urinate on it by accident, i buy this phone again. it doesn\\'t have all the bells and whistles, but it does everything a smart phone should.it is a great phone that came shipped perfectly, no flaws, had a charger and manuals. i bought a trident case for it, and it is amazing, i have reviewed that as well.i have used this phone for years. it messages, calls, is lightning fast on the internet, and doesn\\'t have any os issues. it is durable, and will withstand the daily tumble and minor spills. does not do well in the dishwasher...buy this phone for sure. it is a inexpensive simple phone that does all that most people will need. for the price, it is the best deal i have found. weary nice cell. working with two sim card . fast delivery thank you . this product is excellent. based on the price range you can\\'t beat this deal i\\'ve had my casio rock for about 5 years. love it. thought i\\'d try to find another to use as a spare, but they no longer make the rock. i searched and searched for the boulder, which is the replacement for the rock, and finally found one. you have to be very careful about buying cell phones on the internet because there are retailers who claim to be selling new products, but often they arrive without batteries, backs, chargers, etc. the rock will always be my favorite because it is indestructible (went through the wash once with no problems). the boulder has less rubber and may be not as tough, but it works just fine, holds a charge for quite a while and i have no complaints. you won\\'t find any of these fine casio phones at verizon, so if you want one--and you should--try this retailer. you can\\'t beat the price ($79.) plus a few more bucks for the chargers. very good for price.... excelente no it this not work black scree. awesome phone. i\\'m not into the big phones its much better carrying around a smaller lightweight device. , looks retro and its light weight too. plenty of space for me. simple phone with enough for your essential apps. i have had this phone since june of 2009 and have had little trouble with it. i did buy it unlocked here off of amazon, not sure of the company though. i have had occasional freezing from it, which is the only reson it didn\\'t get a 5 star from me. i have read previous reviews of how it doesn\\'t support internet even in 3g, or that the picture messaging does not work. i have used the web browser in normal service with only 2 bars before. while extremely slow, it does work, so i really don\\'t know where the \"not working in 3g\" came from. also, i have sent, and recieved multi media messages (mms) throughout my time of having this phone. the e-mail client and im client also functions properly. overall, this is a great phone and i highly reccommend it to anyone looking for a cheap, yet pleasing phone. phone was better than expected, would order again from seller i ordered a new phone and they sent me a re-furbished one.the ring level is too low so i miss 1/2 the calls. the ringer cannot be set for individual callers (such as my wife so i never miss that call).the hands free speaker is not capable of picking up my voice so can\\'t do direct hands free.that alarm has the most terrible wake up music and instead of gentle waking you, it jolts you awake and although there are choices they are all not suitable. you have to wake up to set the doze button. the minimum alarm you can set is 5 minutes.the worst part is that the phone keeps making a small ding sound telling me the phone has some message . . . which usually is some program that wants to read my e-mails, my contacts or my location. the phone will not tell me which program it is nor can i set a different tone for each program.want to go crazy? the time is always one hour ahead when roaming and no way to correct it! i did try to change gmt and set it for the cell provider time but neither worked.the camera is workable as long as a flash is not needed. the flash is not coordinated with the shutter so all flash pictures are very dark and not usable. there is no picture stabilization so many pictures come out blurred. the phone works great, i\\'m really happy i bought it what a nice and elegant phone!! at first, i had difficulty choosing between this model and the edge one. finally, i choose versatility and a practical phone. edge is fashion, but in the daily use, i felt it was going to be bigger and uncomfortable to hold/carry.this phone is very fast, just what i wanted. 4g in argentina is fast, so i can netsurf at high speed. i\\'m very happy with this purchase! great samsung product! i saved $150 ordering this from here rather than buying at at&t, it arrived in a factory sealed box, and i have had no issues with this. the employees as the at&t store were very curious where i had bought this phone, and said they had not seen this color s6 available.took about 15 minutes to get a sim card installed & the phone set up. i love this phone! good excelente celular phone was as described works and keeps track of mine activities with calendar option product is reliable and light weight mom loves her phone! nice phone, everything as described best phone i have had so far great phone! thank you! phone cracks very easily, after first crack the bottom half stopped working. the first 4 days i had it the speakers didnt work so i had to factory reset it. other than those problems, i really like the phone. gets what i need done and the camera was great when i could use it. love it, just what i expected! v.g great product. period. best phone i have had in a long time. love the speed in searching mode. :) arrived on time, so far so good. no encoutering any problems. this bb works well. not great. the bold 9780 works much better, faster, and has much better photo quality. both might freeze once in a while but this will do it more often. if you don\\'t mind spending twice as much on a phone, i suggest you the bold model. but if your budget is tight this phone will do it. this phone is a bit pricy, should be $120 for what it is, but bb are generally overpriced. this is a great phone for a person that loses phones constantly and wants a working bb. or if you let your phone fall a lot or let it go for a dive in the pool (even though it will not work later). but if you are a careful person i suggest you buy a bold model, take good care of it, and enjoy its benefits, avoid headaches, and take very good pictures. i value greatly a good camera on a phone because these pictures will last forever if you save them properly. and it is always better to have a good quality camera. imagine taking the picture of your life (with a celebrity, or friends, or idk who) with a bad camera. not worth risking. the curve is ok but the bold is better. the bold is twice the price but twice as better (not perfect thought). good price-quality relation. great battery life...nice audio and signal antennae.... the product was received in great condition and works fine. i used this phone only a couple months and it froze. nobody could help me in the us because this phone was build for asia and doesn\\'t covered by us warranty. now it\\'s just a brick. please stay away from ordering this product! or read carefully about warranty. doesn\\'t have the feel and response of a higher end phone like samsung or lg the battery life its too short, i bought this item for my wife, and she must charge the battery daily, and the she only speak a few minutes on a daily basis. a new battery should have more power life.please notice that you can\\'t view you tube videos if you have an internet plan, since this cell phone does not allow you.if you are looking for a smart phone, spend a little more and buy htc, iphone or bb.also, you must buy a power adapter, since the connector has been made for europe. it is not working. it only worked for just 2 calls.i am returning it hello! i am from venezuela, i received the phone two weeks ago due to heavy delays with the company transfers, i have problems with coverage, i thought it was the phone company and change and still present the problem, call me and the phone appears as despite this off on and when i call and attend the call is dropped, refer to the telephone companies and i mentioned it was the phone problem. but later both receive the phone and i get no options habialitado to contact the seller ... is there any way to report my problem to you help me? ...thanks not overly familiar with verbage. great phone ... just to say that have and great battery on the phone,this is normal use... a great phone for the money. if you don\\'t have to have the latest and greatest then check this phone out. only missing 3gb(it has 2) ram as compared to other top flight phones. this is my 2nd blu phone the 1st one was the blu studio 5.5 and i returned it right away i didn\\'t like it . this one is a big improvement def a great phone . the battery life on this phone is great lasts more than 24 hours with regular usage text , you tube internet, social networks and such. the resolution is nice and bright . the camera is the only thing i don\\'t like , but who cares about that i don\\'t. use a camera if you like to take pictures. overall its a great phone . in the box it comes with a screen protecter and a silicone case . i love the headphones and charger it complements the phone . i did a lot of research before i purchased this phone and i\\'m glad i bought it .i was using a samsung galaxy i717 before this and i love blu life view better .update : i\\'ve been using the blu life view phone for close to 1 month and still love this phone , battery life is awesome don\\'t need to carry no chargers , and a very strong phone . i strongly recommend this phone one of the best buys on a phone! nice phone, has everything i need and cost if quarter of newest model. works as a charm. excellent quality it is a great phone has all the amenities it doesn\\'t allow visual voicemail? but overall i love it. i would recommend it to anyone. was not unlocked!! works as you would expect cant say much else its an iphone excelente can hardly believe this cell was used. took it to my sprint store, along with my damaged one, had all my contacts transferred & i was set to go. very reasonably priced. i love it. m.c. bentheimer exelelente great quality i phone. the phone is okay. it was for my teen daugher. just for calling & texting. however, the seller neglected to say the phone is no longer manufactured, packaged it in a box for another phone, and sent it without directions. because it was to be a gift it would have been nice to have had this info included in the description prior to my purchasing it. had i known i simply would have passed over it. when i contacted them about it they were cold about it. obviously their customers mean little to them. they did offer to give me a refund, but, it was too late. christmas was here. i wouldn\\'t have had a replacement in time to have it under the tree. honesty up front would have prevented the whole thing. oh and they provided a pdf online for the directions. as if i should have to look that up. no. telefono usado, llegó sin los tornillos traseros, en 15 dias de uso, el pin de carga y pantalla dañadosused \\'\\'phone, no screws came back, the pin charging and display damaged nice but doesnt have marshmallow update yet ..waiting for it i completely love my new iphone!! it came with no scratches and right on time! no complaints at all. it was unlocked and i had no issues with connecting with my carrier. thank you soooo much 👍 awesome phone! got here quick too! very impressed. i was a little nervous paying so much online ar first....but when my package arrived i was very relieved. thank you love these phone, one of the best i ever had i\\'m very upset i spent $214 on this phone and i can\\'t hear anyone when i\\'m on a call wonderful i can\\'t say whether or not it\\'s a good smart watch as mine wouldn\\'t turn on and i returned it. amazing. love the battery life, camera and fingerprint sensor ( not to mention the sheer design!) mine was shipped from china. the phone was made by cheap materials. it looks cheap. the ear piece does not fit the phone. the seller did not have any extra one to replace mine. i have at&t, therefore the reception is great. i do not use much apps. the phone has been working fine. it okey great case! i have dropped my phone multiple times while in this case and it has definitely held up! good quality. fits phone well. the only thing i don\\'t like about it is the setup for the headphone jack protector, but that\\'s pretty typical among any case that covers the headphone port. amazing,awesome. i recommend it completely phone developed a problem with the microphone after about 10-11 months of regular use, with the microphone completely failing within days of the 1-year warranty being over. tried hard resetting the phone, upgrading the software to android 6.0.1, but the problem could not be resolved.contacted sony support and after plugging in the imei their website says my phone was not under warranty, even though it was within a year of my purchase date from amazon.also had regular problems with sms messages on this phone - messages received from people would periodically be in all chinese characters (copied and pasted to google translate and the translation made absolutely no sense). i also had quite an unreliable time receiving mms group text messages, with some responses not being received, or in the incorrect order. this is after consulting with the at&t website and confirming that i had the correct apn settings entered.i tried the default sony messaging app, google messenger, google hangouts, textra, and other sms/mms apps, with no success.i have thrown in the towel on this phone, especially after the manufacturer refused to honor the 1-year warranty (as advertised in the product description). **august 2016 update** just loaded cm13 which is android 6 marshmallow! this phone is still going strong!**may 2016 update** just unlocked the bootloader on this phone and installed cyanogen 12. wow, what an improvement!! very happy after owing this phone for almost two years.**update 2015** i\\'ve had this phone for almost a year and just loaded the new lollipop os and it is awesome! a year later and i still love my phone, the battery life, and more importantly the price. you can\\'t beat an unlocked phone fit the size and price running android lollipop.this phone has been great and deserves more publicity. i am giving this review as a long time iphone user and gave up my iphone 5 for this phone. i tried crossing over to the dark side before, but 4 different crappy android phones in a year drove me back to ios. this was before the samsung galaxy phones which i have watched for the past few years. android seems much more polished now and i have no complaints about the operating system.this phone is huge! it is snappy and has handled everything i have thrown at it. i tried to be realistic upon its arrival and not compare this $300 never heard of company before to the same level of a $650 samsung galaxy phone, but i believe it holds its on. this is just as good as flagship phone and could be one. the battery life is good. after 20 hours of heavy use, i was at 20% battery. that is pretty good for this screen size. it has 4g lte, 2gb of ram, and a phone manager cleanup program. if you toss a trident cyclops case on this thing (leave the screen protector on) you will have a nice feeling, sturdy phablet that you will get attention and questions about when you whip it out! so why the 4 star rating? #1 there is not a working amazon app for this phone. that\\'s a biggie since obviously i shop amazon. it let me install it once, but that made my phone crash and keeping rebooting until i did a factory restore. good thing i had issues with my android experience back in the day and made a backup to restore. #2 the phone volume is very very low when making a call. #3 no 4.4 kit kat. while all these things are not deal breakers, they do make this a 4 star instead of 5 star phone. works perfectly no issues i bought this phone as \"new\" ... was not a new phone ... if you want this phone buy it from another seller ... when i opened the box the phone was in a sony ericson box for a flip phone .. i love this phone and expected a new (not used or refurbished one) phone ...now to the problem:#1 i love the phone but the problem is when i use it everything works except when on the internet .. it will connect and stay online for 10 seconds to a minute (longer it you don\\'t try to navigate past the home screen of the page your looking at) then the phone powers down and back up without warning ...#2 the screen blacks out if the outside temp. is over 75 degrees and without warning and to reset that you have to remove the battery for a secondoverall the phone was crap unless that\\'s all you wanted it for was to place a call (like a home phone or cell from the 80\\'s) so i can not stress the fact anymore .. buy it from someone not selling you junk like these guys i received my phone on time and it\\'s working perfect what an upgrade compared to the iphone 4. going to love this phone. glad i got a case for it already and everything. so far so great! i was a little hesitate buying a refurbished phone, but i have had zero issues! it runs great, hardly any scratches or scuffs and the 64gb of storage is amazing compared to the 8gb of storage i had on my iphone 4s. really glad i found this awesome deal on black friday! nice case to protect phone i m starting the headline with that because, they contact me and solve one of my problems. i bought this phone for a birthday present, i bought it on july 9th and the gift was suppose to be opened on 13/09/13. well, she opened the gift, put the battery at the back of the phone, and guess what? it didn\\'t turn on! so, i put the charger on the phone, for about 4 hours to turn it on and guess what again? it didn\\'t turn on.the thing is that i\\'m in venezuela and it will cost me like 40 bucks to send it back to u.s., and i can\\'t afford to do that ( 40 bucks are 1.600 bs. wich is half of the minimun wedge), they refund my money, but the deception does not have a price. smaller than the picture love the price. love the phone. so light. big screen. i might exchange it though because it has been randomly shutting down on its own and the charger squeals when plugged in. i love the phone though so i\\'d definitely want the same one again despite those glitches. i like this product. thank you great phone! am really happy with the samsung note 4. the phone met my expection absolutely, as was described by the seller. i can\\'t complain much about it. it does what it\\'s meant to do and i\\'m happy with my purchase. muchos problemas al escribir this cell phone is very bad. se reinicia solo. the memory is bad. i don\\'t know what happened with the phone. i don\\'t like. great phone at a great price. i would request using a different delivery carrier other than usp. i recently bought this phone from amazon a d found out it is. not unlocked as advertised and spent an hour on the phone (landline) unlocking it. the phone is great otherwise, but had to uninstall all att apps, what a pain, do not know if i would buy another phone from amazon. buyer beware. the phone arrived a couple of days before it was due, a good effort as this was an international delivery. a small problem with the manual was very quickly sorted by their service desk. the phone worked well out of the box and provides everything i need i bought this at very affordable price compared to the apple store. the watch worked like brand new great phone excellent cell phone it works great! muy bueno el producto todo salio bien saludos desde venezuela feliz navidad muchas gracias lo empacaron muy bien feliz año nuevo 2012 6 stars!!!!! very good! i am very happy with the s4 mini. the phone is light weight and the display is really bright. all the apps run just as fast as on the s4 and the battery life will last the whole day. good great phone at a great price! the axon is amazing. the very first thing that i noticed was that it ran super smooth and fast. the lte speeds are amazing. the very first speed test that i did gave me a download speed of 31.97mbps on at&t...super impressive regardless of what i am doing on the device. this zte axon is a beautiful phone has great cameras. the pictures are clean and crisp in the auto setting. the modes settings allows you take choose a ton of options that it make you look like a pro with every shot. love the dedicated camera button. my other favorite feature is the impressive battery life, it last me all day even on super heavy usage days. don\\'t spend $600, $700, $800 or even more when you can get it call with this phone!!! the camera is not 8 mp great cellphone love it this is a back up phone, for that is pretty good, if you need a primary phone go high up in price. everything is fine thanks the flashlight worked. nothing else worked - it said it would work with my puretalk sim.. but it does not. - - so i got the battery in my iphone 3g replaced, and am back to using that one. so, i have a 65-dollar brick. it had scuffs on the sides of the phone but works great bellisimo surprisingly nice phone. first of all it\\'s huge but that\\'s what i wanted. but it\\'s very well built not cheap at all. it connected to t-mobile lte no problems i didn\\'t have to adjust apn settings. display is bright and very nice, not galaxy amoled bright but a nice screen anyway. the skin isn\\'t too over bearing it\\'s pleasant and easy to work with. of course battery lasts well over a day, i had 45% leftover by bedtime. i was happy the phone came with its own screen protector and case. i wish it used microsd card but 32gb internal was ok. overall an excellent phone hopefully posh will come out with some competition for these $800-$1000 phones on the market. instructions not clear hard to set. never got it set. returned it. great phone, easy to use, great camera returned it great phone. so far so good, it is bit larger than i expected, but that\\'s my fault, not the phone\\'s. it has an incredible stand by battery life, i went to bed with 78% battery and after 7 hs, batter was 77%, once the massive screen is in use, well, it consumes the regular battery for that size. but it is good to know that the battery won\\'t simply disappear if you leave your phone for a few hours. great speed, great photos. i was able to upgrade to 5.0 lollipop.mine came as t mobile braded but when i put my argentinian sim card it worked perfectly, so it was unlocked, just not factory unlocked. very good excellent best phone for its price. no other phone in the same price range comes close to what you get from 920. great cellphone at a cheap price good bought two of them and my husband had no problem with his but mine had all kinds of bugs and since i threw away all my info i ended up throwing the phone awaytoo because verizon could not help me with it either it didn\\'t meet my expectation because it had no sim slot available. nice phone, a bit more complicated than my samsung s3 mini it replaces.the big negative is it advertised as new but in fact it was not. originally sold by angel cellular and activated in april 2014 by at&t, confirmed by at&t. very fast good awesome was not a new phone, did not work, was a waste of my time sent it back and bought phone straight from apple. the iphone came in a very good condition, i would say almost mint. the iphone 6 plus is a nice big phone that my wife just love. it\\'s easier for her to type and also works as a very nice ebook reader where now she can see more since the screen is bigger. ok i have been using this phone for a while now. great phone and strong battery life. camera is great for daily, casual use.its a powerful smartphone for a fair price. garbage the best phone ever. i received very defective device. it stoped chargeing only first 2 weeks. first it would show its charging but after 8 hours of charge it would have charged only 5%. and then i did stop charging at all i had email the vendor and they replied after 2 days and then i took them another two more days to give me an email to return the device it will be a return so far so amazing , phones a great buy.. a lot of people are complaining about the screen and speaker ... screen is great and speaker is actually louder than i thought hello, everybody. i have bought this htc and it says that it was unlocked, but its not unlocked. what i have to do to unlock the phone??? please answer me, im not happy with the bought :/ im from brazil. thank you the headphone does not work. served the purpose i ordered this phone in may and it died in july. won\\'t turn on and won\\'t charge. after some googling i came to the conclusion that it has to be replaced somehow. lg phones come with one year warranty automatically so i contacted lg us, and was told there\\'s nothing they can do because they don\\'t have all the parts. then i contacted lg uk and they said they are only able to pick up service requests from uk, even if i spend the $20 to ship it there, they won\\'t be able to ship it back. from my research, this issue is not that uncommon but most customers with this issue are protected with the warranty since it mostly happened within 2 to 6 months, after the amazon return period.therefore if you live somewhere other than uk, please understand the risk before buying. also it doesn\\'t get 4g in us, the top review is for the korean version and this is the uk one.this has been a very expensive lesson for me, please don\\'t make the same mistake. muy bien the phone works great, arrived in good condition. however, the spen that came with it was defective. really awesome cellphone for the price! regular i don\\'t want to write down a full summary of this phone with pros and cons. everyone one has personal opinions and tastes on cell phones, i can just guarantee something, once you have this cell phone in your hand, you won\\'t go back. and the phone does what a high-tech phone is almost obliged to do, there might be a few features that you would like to have like wireless charging, perhaps a better camera (4 ultra pixel is okay, but again, just okay), but in the end, is a piece of art, impressed with the battery life.if you want to have the one android cell phone in the market, don\\'t hesitate and get this cell phone. kuddos to htc, they did make it better. received phone in 2days, was very excited. opened box, put in a t & t sims card. volume good with calls.........but cannot download any apps from play store, always saying time out. works very slow. thinking about returning phone : ( no fun if can\\'t download music and games. bah humbug !!!!!!! sadly my loves phone has been dropped and stepped on, so the screen is so super cracked that he can hardly see through it anymore. fortunately blu phones are the most inexpensive (unlocked) smartphones i have found so i decided to purchase a new one to replace it...found that there is a new version (blu advance 5.0) for like $10 cheaper so i picked that one up instead (will review when it arrives) great phone?!!!!! it didn t say that it couldn t be use in spanish.it is an internacional versión but it doesn t work in spanish. it is a good product. but the screen is not clear. it is very important to me. i bought it for my mother so...it is okay. not a good experience at all. took a while to come in mail. then when i received it. none of the functions worked besides it connecting to phone. i downloaded various bt programs and it still did not work. not a good purchase at all. you all remember the startek; back in the late 90s it was the flip phone. since then no flip phone has ever been the same; i can\\'t flip any of them with one hand with a flicking motion without thinking they\\'ll fly against the wall.since then, i have only gotten bar phones. this one is the best i\\'ve used, of any type of phone. firstly, i love how sony ericcson\\'s handle phonebooks; i don\\'t know why but i like it. when motorolas read my sim card they screw it up and don\\'t read each contact\\'s numbers as a group, they give each number an individual entry. i also think ses have the sexiest fonts and graphics.the thing i like best about this phone is definately the fact that i can hook it up to my computer (it comes with a usb cable, separate from the charging cable, and a 50some mb memory card for starters; it can hold a lot though obviously it\\'s not a portable hard drive but you can buy up to 2 gb so far, higher when you can buy the recently announced 4 gb card) and transfer images, videos, mp3s, and other files to/from the phone. that means i can make custom backgrounds, ringtones, alerts (video, image, or audial) on my computer and then put them on my phone without being charged for sending over the cell networks. also, it has bluetooth and infrared, though i don\\'t have any other devices that use these communication protocols.the real highlight of the phone, besides the fact that it doesn\\'t drop calls ever, is the camera. 3 megapixels is about the best you can get without buying from asia and the quality is great. it\\'s true, at night in large spaces where the light can\\'t reflect back, some residuals show up as artifacts (discolorations) but not enough to detract from all the rest of the features. i feel like my phone\\'s camera has more features than a real digital camera costing $600+. i\\'m gonna turn it on and try to cover them all:there is a \\'frame\\' feature which puts preset cartoony drawings on the screen and then you take a picture that will show up behind it (like an astronaut suit.... so any picture you take will have an astronaut suit overlayed on top of it; it\\'s a good gimmick for kids). there is a panoramic feature: you take 3 pictures from left to right and the camera will merge them for you. there is a feature called \\'best pic\\' which is for drunk or motion pictures: the camera takes 9 pictures very quickly and you can check through all of them to see which ones you want to save. there are also tons of lighting, stability, and other options that i don\\'t use because i trust the automatic settings (they have worked great so far). my favorite options are the effects: color, black and white, negative, orangey (like old-fashioned photos), and overexposed (like a painting). you can take videos in any one of these modes. the video of my girlfriend dancing naked around a pole with black stalkings and heels is the best video i\\'ve ever seen; it was taken in negative mode and her stalkings are white, her skin is blue, her hair is white, and so is her private area... it looks like the gates of heaven.after you take photos/videos, you can also edit them. you can zoom in/out and resave the picture, rotate it, add even more effects, overlay text, combine effects, you can trim videos. the only downside is, when i converted movie files from my computer to 3gp format and put them on my phone, i couldn\\'t edit them in the on-phone video editor because they were too long. i can do that on my computer though; i was just too impatient.also, the screen is large and quality; my friend asked me if this is high def. and i regularly jerk it to porn that i\\'m viewing on the phone. there is plenty of free software available from sony that you can download to the phone (some of which allows you to change the colors of menus, fonts, etc). other features i like: mp3 player, fm radio player, tons of accessories you can buy. i have owned the phone for a month and a half, have been playing with it constantly, and i am still finding new features.people also like my phone; when i tell them it is so new that cingular didn\\'t know it existed when i called to verify that it\\'d work on their network (it does even though they said it wouldn\\'t) and that the only place that sells it is amazon.com, i wonder if they are impressed. i think they are; i am.it sucks to have to pay $370 for a new phone but, screw it, when they release an even cooler phone that cingular knows about, i will get that and sign up for the 2 year agreement.i\\'d bet that anyone who has the insight to buy this phone won\\'t be disappointed. sorry i have delivered today, however from what little i\\'ve seen is good, i\\'ve put my chips on the other phone and has responded well can well say that is functional well for starters it keeps saying that the sd card has suddenly been removed then i shake it and it says preparing sd card. there\\'s no on and off for the shutter sound on the camera and a couple other tech. glitched. not satisfied at all good works very well, and looks as promised. loving my new phone! this is my international phone. it works great.. i like it, shipping early and nice phone. thanks works good ,, as the product was as it was described. works great . i do not have att but straight talk and its does not make no difference compared to att no issues...reached on time and was exactly what was posted. mi good like gold.....love it this phone died fast everyday how bad it only works with t mobile 4g \\'\\'lte the phone was brand new and worked perfectly. great picture quality , lots of space to download apps. absolutely great deal on the phone. have no issues so far would recommend this phone to my friends and family. amazon you rock. i liked the octane lg so much that when i lost it and got it stolen there was no other cell phone i could replace it with in terms of high quality. i received the octane lg many days sooner than promised, and it only took me 10 seconds to activate it. the speaker is very clear and loud. the keyboard is large, sturdy and thick ( not found with other keyboard cells ). it takes good pictures and great 30 sec. videos with clear sounds, plus the battery lasts super long. i dont need internet on my phone, and this phone is the best! until the moment the team result satisfactory to me, very good. is compliantwith my expectations, as indicated in its manufacture is very good. this smart watch by jersa is a nice little watch. although i was not actually able to go online with this phone because i was having technical issues not allowing me to access full use of this cool watch, i did contact the company and they was more than helpful and willing to assist me in fixing the issues. it is easy to get into to put your card in and comes with a instruction pamphlet. it has a nice durable band that adjusts for different size wrists. easy to turn on and off and slides from side to side to access the windows. great company to work with. the phone is great and came quickly, however, the earphones didnt come with the phone. it was clear that someone took them out. perfect for the defender case. it fits snugly and stays secure. delivered in two days. im working off at&t, and it says that its suppose to be fully compatible with 4glte but, its not. i like the phone, but this problem is making want to purchase a different phone that really does give you 4g lte networks this product presents many problems, constantly restarts and the screen turns on and off constantly, when receiving a call or message the computer shuts down, you update the software and the problem still persists, appreciate your help with this problem good i bought this new phone.but never work, only showed the home screen for hours no problems phone was advertised as unlocked but came locked to verizon. had to call and get that taken care of before it could be used. outstanding product. does everything i need. i couldn\\'t see spending twice the price to get an apple product. no contract and unlocked is the only way to fly. phone feels solid, not like a piece of plastic. email and web browsing are a snap. calendar is useful. just as described, delivered on time, works perfect! camera needs to be a little more better!!! excente good product met all my expectations good phone todo ok ok condition works good! fast delivery! had no problems hooking it up with verizon. thank you for the price it is a decent phone. specs, waterproof, weight, and size. the camera however for the high pixels wasn\\'t that great and the phone couldn\\'t record any videos, all we get was a black screen with audio only. after a google search we weren\\'t the only ones experiencing this problem. haven\\'t experience overheating but do get random power off where only a hard reset will solve it, not reliable if it shut off and you\\'re expecting calls or alarms. the seller and shipping was great, not so much the phone. i say pass and get something more reliable and less bloatware. i am buying these for the two landlines i transferred to t-mobile. i have a personal cell spot so reception is superb in my house. however, the phone seemed to drop connection when not being used. when i click on call button to turn on the screen, i often see the connections of both lines in emergency or unavailable status. but then will connect to tmo after a a few seconds. the call quality is spotty at best. when i take the phone to a starbucks next door, the phone lost cell signals.so, the phone is kind of in working condition in my house and seemed to be useless when traveling. i am giving it 3 stars since it works sometimes in my house and does what i need for now. the radio and flashlights are also good features if i don\\'t use it as a phone long term. awesome phone!. it\\'s just amazing :) broke before i even got it on my child\\'s arm. cheap made in china junk. a+ my husband purchased it. his comments are: ok so everyone is entitled to one mistake. this was mine. should have read the reviews more closely. the wrist strap is way to small. the instruction manual is less than useless. can\\'t get the ring tone volume to increase. unless you are tech savvy i would not buy it. gave it one extra star because the mp3 player worked. ( had to buy bluetooth head phones and keep the watch in my pocket.) android smart phone works great and got it at a great price. well satisfied. i am so disappointed! i bought one of these phones and used it for over 2 years and loved it. when i finally bought an iphone, i told my husband this phone was great. however, when we got this phone. it was in good shape. it looked new but the cord that came with it was messed up? when we tried to charge the phone it said this cord is not recommended for this phone. so we have been trying to make it work. but. ow the phone won\\'t even hold a charge! and now it\\'s too late to return it! very disappointed!!! very good cel i had a samsung exhibit for a few years. my son uses the samsung galaxy and just got the 6. he will pay over $700 over the next 2 years for it. i just can\\'t see me paying that much when the blu works just as well for only $120. heck for $700 i can get the best tablet or a really good laptop. as describe by other reviewers it performs as they say it does. very responsive, good battery life and it does everything that i need it to do. great phone for the price. it comes with a s4 charger... excelente good i really like this phone. the screen is beautiful! the rear camera is excellent! the whole thing is very zippy.the downside is that average real use is only about 14-18 hours on a full charge. you must plug it in every night or it will be dead in the morning. if you had a particularly full day of cellular data use, i think the above numbers would be halved down to 7-9 hours. work perfect in venezuela very good condition very high configuration for the price. nice to have this phone lo mejor que pude comprar great sucked. didn\\'t work. came earlier than i expected! great device. good product i like the phone very much for the price. only the battery life is not as great. wondering where can i get a replacement battery as well. vivo en venezuela, el equipo funciona perfecto,buen modelo de bb lo recomiendo, tiene buena camara, es super liviano, de verdad lo recomiendo. el unico detalle es que el telefono no tiene garantia y no trae tarjeta de memoria, pero se le puede comprar una y son bien economicas! exelent do not i repeat do not buy this product this is the 2nd phone i got and its a paper weight the wifi don\\'t work loses range as a customer please do not buy this item no memory space in the phone the phone has exceeded all my expectations. i have no regrets i bought this phone a few months back. after rooting and tweaking the phone a bit it hums along nicely.the biggest plus of this phone is performance to price. i looked long and hard before i made my purchase, and i don\\'t think you will find a better android phone under $200.the biggest drawback this phone has is all the bloatware installed on it. to make it trickier, the phone must be rooted to remove most of it. phone did not work properly. the store i used was quick to fix. all in all i am still a satisfied customer. phone freezes ordered what i thought was a new phone. the packaging looked old and the item wasn\\'t packaged neatly. the plastic covering the sensors and lenses were crooked and there were traces of dust and wear. also, it says d850 on several places inside the phone despite it being a d851. i\\'m not sure if that\\'s normal. the phone is black but the charger is white and appears dirty. doesn\\'t feel right for a new phone.i\\'m returning this phone to seller dps banners. the proximity sensor doesn\\'t work which prevent s the display from turning on during a call. to make things worse there is no way to disable this \"feature\" without rooting. stay away from this phone.i purchased this phone less than a year ago. from the beginning the phone was a little slow to respond in many ways but i could deal with it. about 3 months ago the camera stopped working entirely. i called customer support and was told to do a soft reset, then hard reset. neither of those worked.i asked about sending the phone in for repair and was informed that because this model came from hong kong, that they could not repair it, it is not covered under warranty, i would have to contact the hong kong customer service. i have been back and forth between both hong kong and us customer service, both of them just give me the run around and refuse to take responsibility for their faulty product, and will not repair it. after contacting the us customer service again, they advised me to do a software repair. i followed the steps and now my phone is entirely stuck on the beginning intro screen and will not function at all. in other words, right now i paid over $500.00 for a non functioning phone with sony refusing to fix their faulty product.this phone is a giant lemon, and after dealing with sonys customer service i will never purchase a sony product again. excelente ok, but didn\\'t know cannot access battery for replacement if it ever died in the future over all the phone is good, but did not come with a battery as stated in the profile. some small scratches, not too bad. really good product, the phone works great. works really fine with the operators in colombia. if you can, you must have this phone. has good features but the quality is not there. i love the phone! it came quickly and was unlocked and the model i ordered, and my changing carriers worked fine. many great features on phone and beautiful display. a great improvement over my iphone 4 in so many ways el bb 9780 llego en perfectas condiciones, nuevo, con su pila, cargador y demas originales, la memoria de 2gb..,lo unico que la banda 3g es solo 1,2,4 ( es decir digitel )... excellent i was blown away with the quality and performance of this phone. i\\'m used to higher end smartphones so i wasn\\'t expecting much from a sub $100 phone but this moto e has features that you only find on phones of twice or even three times this price point. it\\'s amazing motorola was able to pack so many feature at this price point and keep the quality of the phone still quite high.has bluetooth le so it works great with my smartwatch, extra microsd card for storing music and apps, android 4.4 and the battery life is amazing! i can easily get two days of use with just one charge. i bought the us gsm version to use on t-mobile and i\\'ve been getting hsdpa speeds without any kind of issue both in california and florida.overall i\\'m extremely happy with this phone and i keep it as my little back-up/travel phone. recommended very good phone 100% great phone! battery gets low very quick and even worst when you play games and takes an eternity to fully charge and the phone gets hot. other than that its good and excellent 👌 camera had to get camera fixed when it come in. phone works good. won\\'t buy another from them. arrived on time! has a few scratches but it works and i\\'m happy about this product ok.. gracias excellent phone! i am using it as a tablet (no phone service) and it\\'s much better than tablets, unless you need a larger tablet to double as a laptop. the size is perfect for my stocky hands, and at less than 5 ounces, it beats even a small tablet, like fire hd 6, which weighs over 10 ounces. the screen size is the same as iphone 6 plus, and for a good reason. anything bigger than this would be awkward to carry around. the sim card from my defunct tracfone (lg840g, which is not even an android phone) works in my posh. it just sees it as a new sim. of course, if you want to have a cellphone service, you will have to purchase a sim from a service provider (at&t, t-mobile, straight talk, etc). the screen resolution (1280x720) is quite adequate for all practical purposes; it comes out to about 267 ppi. so far (after a couple of weeks of usage) i would highly recommend this phone, if you want an android phone (or a small tablet). note: if you intend to use it only as a tablet, then turn on the airplane mode, so it won\\'t be constantly searching for a cell signal, as it will drain battery. then turn the wifi on (in this order). when i received the watch a month i no longer returned to work well, bataria not charged, the headset will not work at this time are useless don\\'t buy this phone!big buttons! great! but the navigation ring around the enter button was a nightmare to use. it kept turning on the radio and good luck with turning the damn thing off. the task bar was ridiculous for a senior to try to use. the icons are framed with a tiny,tiny little blue outline which is impossible to see unless you are looking at it though a magnifying glass. also, there are two slots for sim cards. if you only fill one, the \"insert sim card\" wording still stays on the screen which is a distraction. sound quality was good but the navigation around this phone is bad thing that just kills what could have been a great little phone. in addition, tell me what good big buttons on the phone is good for when the instructions (what there are of them) are printed in size 4 font. what senior citizen could read them? worst phone i have ever bought and i am returning it immediately. i got a white phone, while i ordered black. the speaker in the phone is very weak and hard to hear. excelente phone was great and met all expectations.at the begining i thought i can\\'t connect to the cellular network with a new sim. requested for support through email, this was a little slow and not helpfull.eventually found out (myself) i just had to restart the device after inserting the sim. would not work right with straighttalk but the phone itself is great ! phone was worse than expected with dents on back and damage to all corners. so far screen is flawless and phone stays charged, works well. this product is excellent\\'m very really exceeded my expectations thank you very much. i hope to keep getting your offers of other products. i can\\'t get the thing to sync with my phone. i even watched several youtube videos on how to do it and still can\\'t figure it out. can\\'t find the sound to turn it down or off. can\\'t pull up the apps section most of the time. sending it back. don\\'t waste your money! phone works fine the home button doesn\\'t work every few times, said it was like new which it is besides that. a little disappointed i am very satisfied with my phone great phone, great battery life, super light but does not included all att lte bands. this is basic, but has all the features necessary for seniors. i use it when i travel abroad and use a local sim card. dual card is a little confusing and i don\\'t have a handle on it yet. maybe on my next trip. this is a replacement for one that i broke. it is as expected a functional unit i bought this as a gift. my husband has had nothing but problems with this phone. he took it to a t-mobile store and was told it is not compatible with their network. i bought it because the description says it works on gsm carriers like att and t-mobile. so that is obviously deceptive. verizon does not recognize the phone. it cannot be activated. i received the phone and it was clearly locked to verizon. waste of money with the title clearly stating it is unlocked. very nice its working just fine i rate it a 5 star.... my daughter is very happy and pleased with it.... good! works as supposed definitely great for its price, especially since it\\'s an unlocked phone. never heard of figo but thought i\\'d try it out.speed - the biggest downside. a bit slow when booting up, starting up apps, and navigating throughout.battery life - only like 8-10 hours before i have to charge again.mobile tethering - thank god this phone can tether and do hot spots no problem. my previous htc one m7 couldn\\'t do it without rooting.resolution - pretty decent interface, takes decent photos/videos overall.data - automatically turns off when i\\'m using wifi so i can\\'t receive mms while on wifi.phone case - it\\'s flimsy so i don\\'t imagine much protection if i drop the phone. it is nice protection from the rain, and you can use it as a stand while watching netflix which is a plus.if you\\'re on a budget and want a solid, unlocked smartphone, this is a must buy. issues with this that remain unresolved. my 1st review was removed. let\\'s see if this one stays. not happy!! i would not recommend!! so far only complaint is difficulty figuring out how to get nano sim card in it...and a bit of att junk software. you can root the phone but there\\'s not root control software for this version yet. yes, it does, the 128mb ram arent enough. the phone would be perfect if the people at nokia included 256mb ram. it is very slow and wo graphics accelerator so no fancy games or apps. other than that it would make a dream phone. too bad.ohhh and btw, theres software included that you cannot delete, and the office part of the phone sucks too, you cannot edit office files, only view and the pdf reader is a 30 day trial. for that kind of money... its a nice cellphone love this phone. my son in law recommended it, i am so glad he did. my mom loves it. excellent phone, completely tackles everything i throw at it. phone calls are great and clear, texting is sharp and crisp, the camera is amazing!pros:phone call qualityease of useperformancecamera qualitywaterproofcons:slippery in the handnon-removable battery very clean product two thumbs up. arrived early, met all expectations great phone. came before was expected good pictures 4week very nice. 好看不卡 no doubt made in usa. actually the xiaomi of usa. but we have a new problem. starting this year blu. have decide to add their own ui on top of android. this ui is immature ,useless ,bloatware and. unrootable. i will never use another blu product as long as this bloatware is present. i know ui leads to control which leads to an ecosystem which leads to blu pay which leads to wall street listing worth a billion. but this is not the time blu. we have long way to go. at least give us option to remove this bloat ware. very nice phone i thought is was new ...but it wasn\\'t ...... some times it will work and sometimes it won\\'t.. phone was not new as listed on amazon. phone was blacklisted so it couldn\\'t be used. i was very disappointed with this purchase. camara y flash deficiente has software problems very good product for the price, particularly when you see the price new. delivery was slower than advertised. speaker whiskey poor, bought a different blu model and big difference! perfect fit, husband is able to find the phone easily with the yellow accent color at first i really liked this phone. about 4 months into use the battery stopped charging. i had to send in the phone for a replacement.it took 2 1/2 weeks for return of my repaired phone. shortly after the gps stopped working properly and the gorilla glass shattered on a very low drop. i am hoping somebody from posh mobile or amazon will read this review and make things right. not real happy with my posh mobile experience! nice watch, worked nicely and had a nice camera... will buy again it\\'s been used on gsm network in africa. memory want 1gb device arrived in 2 days...in excellent condition!!!! clean, transferred w/no issues...updated already...accepted my 16g mem card...i might be be kinda happy....just might be...... the best not a huge fan of the operating system but the phone itself is awesome! i buy the galaxy s4 here in usa for my girlfriend .. and when my girlfriend went to venezuela after two months ruined. when connected to charge after a few hours not charge anything. i\\'m upset because i paid nearly $ 600 dollars and for two months was ruined. i feel sorry for my girlfriend who was his first galaxy s4. disappointed with this seller \"acceptable\" but the condition was actually impeccable. 👍🏽 this watch is great! i no longer need to carry my phone while exercising and it sends me reminders to get up and move if i have been idle too long. best part is the ping to breathe, and tells me my heart rate after - i haven\\'t taken it off since i bought it! the watch is connected and off all the time i bought this handset for a friend after reading on the web a lot about how good is the device for an android starter user. what can i say... my buddy is really happy with it so i have no complains.. over a year later and still very happy with this product! because it don\\'t work with verizon company. this is a great stand espicially for the price range it is in. very nice wood and seamlessly put together. it has an attached power cord along with three spaces on the back for plugging in charges cords. it has a great space for your iphone and an extra slot for another device as well. overall this is a very nice piece. great phone...used it as a gift! the phone is great. the dealer i bought from not so great. when i bought this phone for my daughter for her birthday recently, she was very excited with all it\\'s features. however, the charging cord for the hdmi dock was damamged upon arrival, and when i complained to breed, he first sent the wrong charger cord, then when i contacted breed about the incorrect charger, he then claimed he never sold me the dock to start with. my only option was to return the phone, insured, and wait several weks for reimbursement. as the replacement charger was less than $10, i chose to replace the cord myself, rather than deal with all the hassle, as i\\'m sure breed was counting on. do not buy from dealer breed. this phone have bad quality the sound barley works the screen blanked out after the first day of having it i do not recommend anyone to order this phone. ordered it and it came on time, nothing wrong with the phone. it only cost $15 for a sim card to activate your phone or switch phones (same carrier). truly decent.((my carrier is t-mobile)) owned this phone for over 6 months and it has been generally great!well worth the price.however, 8gb internal storage memory is not enough for me otherwise an excellent phone - -processing speed is great.wish the 64gb memory card could allow freeing up more space on the internal 8gb.even though i store everything possible to sd card - always have insufficient internal storage to download new apps.camera is just okay not amazing in low lightbattery life is awesome and this is where this phone shines the best - full day and still 30-40% battery remaining... best inexpensive phone ever, it beats iphone 6 at many tests ok watch. early and novel concept. lack of storage for apps about 250megs makes it about useless. very satisfied with the product and the services i love it great product a + + + + + + + + + + + + ++ + i not satisfied with this phone not working properly i love this iphone! the color is distinctive and it\\'s easy to use. everything i need right at my fingertips. over the weekend i shows this to a bunch of relatives. even set it next to a relative\\'s samsung s6 and it looks just as nice. battery life is incredible.in a world where the latest iphone is $1000 and the latest flagship samsung device is 1/2 to 3/4 of that price you really have to wonder how bad a $110 phone is. supridingly, this is an excellent phone. it may not be the best at any one thing but really aren\\'t any glaring deficiencies. the screen is big, high resolution ips and bright. the phone is responsive and the relatively stock android operating system is easy to use and customize. the battery life is excellent. blu tosses in a cover and screen protector for free. this phone is kind of a no-brainer for those who don\\'t want to invest a lot of cash or if they have kids who abuse phones. you can even run dual sims and expand the storage memory. it has a nice solid fell and looks and fells like a much more expensive phone. i like it a lot![+] notable feature: dual sim slots[+] display: 5\" ips hd, 720x1280,gorilla glass 3 (scratch resistant)[+] os: android

my phone just died after 6 months. will not charge. be very careful this company has terrible customer service. :) great watch for the price bluetooth app isn\\'t very good but i put my sim card in and it worked great! also i havent figured out how to use the browser yet each time i load google.com it says connection failed. not good at all well it\\'s working but not i expected!! it does some weird features like it got zoom out when i\\'m texting and sometimes got kinda frozen too... mmmmmm kinda disappointed!! pros:battery life was excellent. 3 weeks with active use.simple to use and easy to navigate.seems to be very strong and doesn\\'t mind being dropped unlike a smartphone.cons:no t9 for text messaging, no predictive dictionary .kinda bummed me out but it\\'s not a deal breaker.nothing else has really come up. great phone for the price. wish the battery lasted longer. had to download the apn settings for my carrier from youtube for 4g lte and it was easy. good phone was unlocked and worked with other country sims.conno head phones jack it is a good cell phone, if you want a phone that meets the basic functions.the downside is that the camera shutter is slow and you have to keep the pose long. works good but keep cutting out ,keep turning it back on , will return number are small and a bit bulky i like it for what you are paying, this phone is absolutely fantastic. the only problem that i have had with it is the storage on the phone itself, but there is the option to add more storage. it is definitely worth the money. the screen is clear and big enough so you don\\'t have to strain to see anything, yet it isn\\'t so big that it is cumbersome. good product great phone was bummed out to find out after hooking it up i could have got a note 4 for $75 more then what i paid for this and amazon wanted $175 more it does not protect my whole phone tl;dr pro/con list at bottom.i will start off this review by saying that i really wanted to love this phone. it does have some very good qualities about it. but the phone has its faults, which are enough for me to not give this phone a recommendation. i have used the phone for approximately 6 months.by background is that i worked in the cell phone industry selling phones for years, before moving into corporate it and networking. i have been a amateur phone enthusiast and have easily had over 30 phones in my day. i also take exceptional care of my belongings, electronics getting special care. seeing as this phone is a bit expensive for the size, it was a bit of a treat for myself as the specs and design looked like everything i wanted.hardwarescreen is a nice size for one handed use. is very crisp and easy to see inside and outside in bright sunlight. physical buttons are a tad awkward being so low on the device, but worked well for how i hold a phone. they provide enough click, but are a little hard to \"feel out\" and press during a call. volume on the dual speakers is adequate for a small phone and produce decent sound. sound through earphones is very good. 2 gb of ram is more than enough to power the 720p screen and the 810 processor never lets up. the fingerprint scanner is top notch. works very fast and recognizes fingers well. it allows 5 fingers to be registered. i did my wife\\'s thumb, left index, right index, and my right thumb twice for better accuracy on my main digit. sometimes i would pull the phone out of my pocket and it would already have registered my thumb and unlocked itself.ui, performance, and battery lifethis phone came with android lollipop and is now updated to marshmallow. the ui runs well. the fast processor and 2 gb of ram don\\'t let this phone slow down much if at all. sony\\'s take on android is a very clean and minimal. although there is plenty of sony \"bloatware\" apps that come preinstalled and cannot be removed. you can \"disable\" them so they are no longer active and don\\'t appear in the menu, but still live on the device. the snapdragon 810 does still tend to get hot at random times. an app may be running in the background and you can feel the phone get much warmer. never hot that you feel in danger, but warm enough to warranty a reboot in my opinion. once back up the device was cool again. battery life on the phone is decent, but not close to the expectation that sony has set with previous devices in the series. it will get you through a day easily with moderate to heavy use, and can easily stretch to two days with light use. recharge time however is very long. if you plug into a pc to charge expect at least 3 - 4 hours to charge it up. a quick charge adapter is a wise investment if you get this phone.apps and gamingi largely got this phone for remote play on the ps4; that feature worked wonderfully with no issues. while the small screen was a little hard to see at times, i never had an issue with pairing the ps4 controller via bluetooth or playing over wifi. the stock messaging app always gave me trouble with mms messages, even with the correct settings from at&t. i constantly got a you have an mms to download message even though i already read the message. textra fixed that issue and is a much better messaging app in my opinion. i don\\'t really play any other types of mobile games, but companion apps for destiny, metal gear solid v, and standard apps like the weather channel all ran great on the device. as mentioned before there is a lot of sony branded items that are just flat out annoying and not needed.camerawonderful camera. loved to take pictures with this phone. they almost always come out clear and sharp. with the latest updates the camera opens quickly. the phone does a good job of fast auto-focus as promised. the shutter key on the side of the device is great for open the camera quickly and nice to take a picture. finger placement while holding the phone is a bit awkward as the camera is very close the the top edge of the phone and gets covered easy if you are not careful. i spent most of my time in superior auto mode which produces 8 mp images. going into manual will give you an overwhelming amount of options and allow full 23 mp pictures.designlooking at the phone it screams premium. add waterproofing to the device and that is just piece of mind that some rain or accidental spills will not harm the device. no flap for the charge port is also wonderful as i\\'ve seen my share of them get damaged on phone such as the galaxy s5 which kills the waterproofing of the device. the phone has a heafty weight to it that also feels good. the frosted glass back looks very nice and does not attract fingerprints. the phone is very slippery. on a scale of 1 to 10 with 1 being course grit sand paper and 10 being metal coated in teflon covered in olive oil, this phone is a 9 easy. the phone literally wants to slide out of your hand whenever you hold it. if nothing else a case is needed to provide some grip to the phone. having a glass front and back also made me extra cautious and nervous about potential cracks. but i have always taken care of my devices and never cracked a screen.phone callsphone calls on the device were clean on my end every time. there were issues for the other caller especially when i used speaker phone. callers would often complain that they heard themselves or that they could not hear me until i went back to the earpiece. it also appeared that using the speaker phone only used the bottom speaker and not both.durabilitythis phone is by its very nature fragile. with over 90% of the outer casing being glass, you better believe this baby is delicate. the phone came with a pre-installed screen protector, but it became cruddy very fast. i normally don\\'t use a screen protector and have never had an issue. i somehow managed to put a small scratch on the screen while it was in my pocket with nothing else in it one day while hiking. it was no big deal, as i couldn\\'t see it when the screen was on, but i knew it was there and worried me that it got damaged so easily. now just recently a friend placed my phone near a counter edge, and a got a few messages in a row that made the device vibrate right off the edge. of course it landed face down on kitchen tile. screen completely shattered and the touch screen stopped functioning altogether. i am not knocking this phone because of my stupid mistake, not many phones if any would survive a fall like that. instead it just goes to show that a rugged case is just about required for this device. which is a huge bummer since the phone looks so good.tl;dr and pros/cons listpros-- nice screen for a smaller phone-- beautiful design-- great camera-- fast performance-- sony\\'s ui has a good design-- waterproof-- native ps4 remote playcons-- sony bloatware that cannot be removed, just disabled-- slippery-- fragile-- poor speaker phone quality for the other caller-- awkward button placement-- very slow charge time-- expensive-- sony is slow to update uiconclusion and thoughtsthe phone is not worth the price. the camera is very nice and waterproofing is a big plus, but a few nice features do not outweigh the fact you are terrified to accidentally drop such an expensive phone. if you don\\'t let anyone else touch this phone, and put it in a really hard-core case, it may last you a good while. if you live in the real world where you may leave you phone on a desk, give it to someone to take a picture of you, or bump into something with the phone in your pocket it may be dropped and will break. very durable. this product mates to the needs that i have, and i liked the practical and the good way its, i recommend it to general public great phone. i recommend it. the only negative is that this phone is deceptively described as \"international\" whereas it will not work from europe to asia where different frequencies are used. truly international multiple-frequency cell phones are sold and cost 2x as much.the phone description should be gt-i8190 l - the l suffix meaning latin is because it will only be international in the americas and maybe japan. do not buy this phone. within two weeks of owning it the headphone jack already had a problem and the phone will not charge. when i discovered the headphone jack problem, my left earbud was not working. i tried several pairs of headphones to find that the jack was the problem. i looked up possible ways to solve the problem only to find that i would have to replace the whole lower part of the phone. secondly, the phone began acting funky yesterday. the phone had been charging for a while and when i checked it, it only said it had been charged up to 8%. i had to turn off my phone and turn it back on to find it was at 40%. and right now it will not charge. it told me that my charger was not a supported accessory. the phone has been plugged in all night and still hasn\\'t charged. i have not tried a different charger yet, but i shouldn\\'t have to. this was a waste of money. i do not blame apple, because i\\'ve bought from them directly before and it was wonderful, but i would not recommend buying from this seller. if you want and iphone just save up your money and buy directly from apple. it\\'s worth it. this j7 is as good as any s series phone.it has the best interface i have see in any phone.i have own s 3 ands4 and i rate this phone much better. my son likes his i-phone this phone is just as good as an i phone or android glad i purchased it realy liked this phone. is my first smartphone. it\\'s fast, beautiful. works fine with the network in my home. but i had a problem to use with voice calls and text. this phone don\\'t works with at & t chip. i read this on internet:\"in china, there are three carriers: china mobile, china unicom and china telecom.china mobile: td-scdma (no carrier in usa has this network)china unicom: wcdma (similar to att)china telecom:cdma2000 (similar to verizon)s898t is only compatible with td-scdma so i think you can only use gsm in usa with this device.\"i liked, it\\'s a perfect cell phone, except by the fact that can\\'t be used as a cell phone. i dont have a lot to say other then buy this phone. the camera quality is better than most iphones. i\\'ve compared with my friends. and it\\'s a huge difference especially in dark places. screen is the best i\\'ve ever seen. gaming is the best i\\'ve seen. and very fluid. i\\'ve played on notes and iphones before and the frame rate is just insane for a phone of this price. and is better and more fluid than any phone i\\'ve owned. this is also the first phone that i\\'ve never had to use a sd card on. 64 gigs and a huge battery too. blu is the future!!!!update:i have to take off two stars because the video recording quality is good but the audio is horrible. i\\'ve had phones in 2010 that would record clear high quality audio. it shouldn\\'t be that hard to put a better audio recorder or better audio format. i take good pictures with it and good videos. but the audio is just useless. i went on trips with this phone and the audio is something that really messed up the experience and memories of the footage i recorded in different countries. but all and all its a good phone for day to day use and gaming, camera but audio sucks. took a very long time to arrive. the phone would not read the att card. instructions in chinese. time wasted waiting. i had to return it. i have a a806 i use in asia. one of 4 phones had excessive bloatware that could not be removed without professional help. lenovo sellers need to be more responsible in their sales / claims. phone works great excelente everything is awesome, phone is great, you have everything on it, so you can\\'t be unsatisfied. it\\'s little bit heavy, but it\\' perfect is not an iphone, i bought a fake iphone. this is a fantastic phone well worth the money i don\\'t even want to open my computer any more .if you going to try to root this phone it\\'s patched so you will have a hard time to do so but the rest is great working still after a few a months of purchase this phone is fantastic. i bought used via amazon warehouse \"like new\" condition - wow the condition was perfect - no scratches, no dust and it works beautifully. battery life - omg what can i say - it is so great not to have to charge the phone a couple of times a day.i didn\\'t think i would like the iphone being and android user all these years. i glad i made the switch. the screen size is smaller than my old phone, but not by much. i had looked at the iphone6 - found that too big, the size of the 5s is just perfect perfect!! it gives you the options of touch screen and keyboard, takes beautiful pictures with or with out flash....this phone is fully equipped. received this phone , plugged it in for an entire night, wake up the morning and tried to put it on, and it never came on. returned it. handy item good seller so so phone alot of i just wanted a phone for emergencies and texting and this phone does that. the call quality is good, texting is a bit tricky, buttons are small, small dictionary to add words to but you get used to it. not a lot of ringtones but that\\'s fine. the camera isn\\'t great but i didn\\'t get it for that and don\\'t use it. it has a good calculator and calendar, both of which i use often. durable. is very good.... better of i expect... nice cheep wonderful, wonderful, wonderful.. got the phone before they said i would and it was perfect. i was nervous buying a phone in this manner but, i was worried for nothing. the phone was great and the seller was fast, honest and had a great product. i am soooooo happy. phone in great condition but crappy phone in my opinion. awesome had the phone for a day, first impressions are great. phone is great. very powerful, great screen, responsive. i\\'m running full linux on it without breaking a sweat. it\\'s unlocked, and the process of transferring my service from my iphone\\'s nano sim to a new (compatible) micro sim was painless on at&t. one thing. as of 8-7-2016, it\\'s difficult to root. very difficult to root (kingo and king don\\'t work, nor does basically any other popular one-touch root). ships with lollipop, and the only way to root is apparently to upgrade to marshmallow, and mine won\\'t, so i\\'m waiting on a reply from asus as to what to do. be wary of that. also, little things, but the battery seemingly shifts when moved from side to side. it never comes out of contact, but mildly annoying, also the home buttons and stuff don\\'t light up if that matters.bottom line: build quality 8/10, software 7/10 (rooting 3/10), battery 9/10, screen 10/10, heat management 8.5/10p.s. tap the build number 7 times in settings > about > software to get developer settings. works as intended with no issues. exelente producto i\\'ve purchase this nokia asha 306 as a \"gift\"..., during my visit on september 2013 in usa. coming back home in africa ( douala-cameroon) i\\'ve offered this to my girl friend, after a week of using the touchscreen doesn\\'t work properly, and time to time this fone were missing and loosing the local network signal. poor communication whenever you need to call or receive a call... most of the capabilities do not work properly, and make me disapointed about this product.......unfortunatly i\\'m already far away from us and no way to claim the reimbursmentmy advise to any customer it\\'s: don\\'t buy that product to avoid facing the same disapointment i ordered my phone for a fantastic price, it wa shipped within a few days, i had a tracking number and it arrives before its scheduled time. when i recieved th phone it was exactly how they said it would look and i was very happy!! thank you! good phone ...long battery duration. ..4 stars coz we cannot pair with it galaxy watches. .. excelent i recomend you el telefono es muy práctico y completo. la camara toma buenas fotos y es bastante funcional.nokia se la comió con esta versión económica del n97 i am pleased with this blackberry phone! the product and seller met all expectations. the phone is great. my son is very happy with it! this was a gift that made my man very happy. it has a great camera and does good video. some of the controls are a small (volume rocker) excelente recomendado good phone! love it the device stalls all the time!!!!! do you know how frustrating it is to wait 60 seconds to get to the menu? i do! my curve is light-years faster than my 9760. nothing seems wrong. as soon as i get my new sim card, i\\'ll be greatly satisfied. it is a unique mobile. it works well and makes oyu independant of the iboys and droids. this is how a smart phone should work ! i really like the fone but that battery looses charge too fast. fine great case! has good texture so i don\\'t lose my grip. this is a great starter phone for a kid or for someone who would like an android phone but doesn\\'t need the horsepower or 4g data. i like that the phone is just over $100 and is not subsidy locked so i can take it to any gsm carrier. it only has 4gb of storage, but it has a micro sd card expansion slot, you can you expand your storage pretty cheaply, a feature missing from most flagship phones. for the price, you can\\'t beat it. i looked past the fact the this phone came from the middle east somewhere. the phone does not work in china with a china sim card but it was sold as an unlocked gsm phone.. if it was a gsm phone it should work in any country an excellent powerful phone at a reasonable price. the service was wonderful and speedy. the only displeasure that i have is the position of the charging port. i would have preferred if it were at the bottom of the phone. so far, so good. i hesitate to give five stars, simply because i\\'ve only had this phone for a week. my primary concern with this kind of purchase, as is demonstrated in some reviews with such products, is whether this previous generation of smartphone is truly new and authentic. once the newest and hottest smartphone version hits the market, any remaining new stock of the previous version is discontinued or swiped up fast (particularly if the previous version is better than the newest). as anyone who has been looking for these models can attest, a lot of the options are refurbished, open-box, unlocked, or most importantly claimed as new but not really. then you have the issue with whether the model is \"international\", gsm or something else that might prevent it from doing what the buyer wants it to do.so, i\\'m happy that i found this at a reasonable price and from a seller that i was able to research and develop some confidence in. i was also able to rely on the amazon return policy in case things didn\\'t work out. blutekusa is the seller, in my case, and i have been quite happy with the result. i believe the phone is indeed new, and perhaps even factory-unlocked versus the seller doing it. and it is the real deal, with all the standard, original accessories included.the phone itself works quite well, compared to my galaxy s3. i have t-mobile, and this is an at&t unlocked phone (that\\'s what the \"a\" means, in the g900a model), but i was able to simply take my sim out of my old phone and insert it into the new phone, do some manual setting of the 4g ling so that i could highlight and pick t-mobile (more networks, mobile networks, apn setting to t-mobile), and everything works fine. the performance is improved. the battery is stronger, longer lasting and recharges much faster than the galaxy s3. it was already updated to android 5.0 lollipop, and while not a rooted device, i\\'m satisfied with the operation. i have 45 days with the htc smartphone and is presenting a problem with the rear camera is not working. check with htc and they told me that the problem is hardware. and that i take to chcek it where i buy this smartphone. please, i need a solution. arrived on time with no issues 1st one wouldn\\'t activate on att network. seller was great and send out a replacement. replacement woudn\\'t activate either. spent an hour on chat with att and got it to activate. worked for about 2 hour and then lost connection. connection would come and go for a couple hours, usually came back after a reboot or when connected to computer via usb. then would disconnect when unplugged or after a call was made. totally unusable. seller again offered to send a replacement but by that time the phone was smashed into many small pieces. too bad, i really like the old school razr form and function, but i guess i\\'ll be forced into using new technology. i\\'m glad i chose lg g3. i love all it\\'s features. the gps, camera and the sound is amazing, never had the sound so sharp with my sony xperia. my co workers are jealous. will recommend. wanted a simple phone, and this is it although great call would like to sell extras to bump the price of monthly phone bill up to rival a regular cell phone bill.stick to the basic phone bill and it is worthwhile, but if you want extras , buy a regular phone to get the features you want. reception at my home location is poor to non existent so can not use at home but i do take it on the road where i can expect to have reception. overall not bad but if you use the camera at all stay away from this phone you can not take a picture the is not blurred. i will not use it long, you get what you pay for. i purchased this phone took it to the verizon corporate store and was told it was not a verizon phone.wrip off!!!! seriously so impressed. it came new, in the box and it even had the plastic wrap still around the box. took it to verizon to activate it and haven\\'t had a single problem with it. thank god. (: i like it a lot thanks very happy with the phone inspite of few bugs and slowness, i like it. fingerprint recg is superb, overall a nice package. 100% recomendado i\\'m new to the android phone world. this is the highest end phone i\\'ve ever had.first, the phone arrived a couple days *ahead of time.* awesome.the phone is made of plastic on the back and sides but it\\'s made in a far more sturdy presentation than what i expected. i\\'m very pleased with that.overall the phone is great and the screen is vibrant. this phone seems like a great bang for the buck. the camera is pretty good too--though i\\'ve only taken a few photos in not the best of light and have yet to really test out the camera fully, but the images thus far are good nonetheless.at first i didn\\'t realize a protective plastic covers the back camera lens, so, my first picture i took with the camera came out not very clear looking. but once i took the plastic off the colors and detail popped out more.the phone has google voice commands too. you can tell the phone to call certain numbers. very cool!the one downside is that the battery--when watching videos etc.--does not last as long as i hoped. between 1 to 10 with 100 being the highest, i\\'d give the battery a 5 or maybe 6 at the most. i wouldn\\'t give it below a 5 though. it\\'s still decent enough for a battery.i highly recommend this phone. great phone! it\\'s a very good phone for the price! , camera without flash, isn\\'t problem, battery charge is so long (2 days) a lot, i\\'m happy with my moto e!! buy this phone now!!!! was very satisfied with my purchase. great phone great deal. will buy again when the time comes around. hopefully soon. the cell phon never work well good phone. i needed this for australia and it worked awesome. the touch screen is a little off but it does the job of making calls and using maps just fine. does take a little bit of time to get used to the touch. it\\'s fun that this new version of jitterbug does more, but that makes the phone more complex, of course.i bought the phone for my 70 iq sister, and she needed more training than i expected. she was moving up after having the older, simpler version for years, so i expected her to simply take it and start using it.it\\'s a nice phone, and she loves the red color. she also likes the idea that it has a camera. now we\\'ll see if she can use that without having me around. it\\'s ok delivery was prompt. great value for the money. it would be great if there is a switch for volume control and turning the display off so it does not come on when any key is pressed unintentionally. can\\'t complain, it\\'s a samsumg. works perfectly bad product freeze n goes through an unending loop or power cycle to turn on. looks nice but serious app problem. won\\'t recommend to anyone at all save your money. amazon however did refund my money back... the phone would not get service. i purchased 3 phone s on amazon. only one was not hacked. i will not buy another phone on amazon. good it was a good phone with good voice quality, but it has a bad charging and battery life. it quit taking a charge and i only had it a little over one month. i decided after i contacted the seller (just cellular, who were very good about return policy) that i would get a refund for this phone. you can\\'t get apps for this phone. the battery, you might get three or four days even if it is sitting idle. overall i would it (0-10) a 5 for charging and an 8 for quality. it says it is ip67, but mine died when battery go heated up during exposure to direct sunlight in arizona recently. this happened not once but several times. also the seal for usb connector is poorly designed since it does not accommodate other micro usb dongles and i had to file off the opening for it accept non-b15 supplied micro usb. it\\'s nothing but a regular android with a \\'fancy\\'-ly designed exterior and expensively licensed logo of caterpillar. i wasted my $300. i have used htc phones for years. i love this phone. i didn\\'t get the m8 because i couldn\\'t afford it. it doesn\\'t matter to me because this one is still an upgrade from what i had. the phone was very easy to set up on straight talk. i love this phone and it\\'s so easy to set up your personal preferences. i was lost with the samsung 3 that i kept only for 2 months. great phone. it is hard to use with one hand unless you have very large hands. but using this makes me use my ipad mini less. excelent product the cell phone never turn on, is damaged. i have other before, this cell is amazing, but nokia have some problems whith the power on... the phone came in on time and looked awesome. it was fantastic at first worked great but by the third month of having it the phone has screwed up completely and i have to buy a new phone now because of it. dont waste your time and money with this product. im serious...you will find yourself pissed off and broke without a phone el equipo cumple contodas las especificaciones que se establecen en el articulo, muy buen equipo, recomendado a los usuarios de los mismos excellent replacement given our circumstances, but the ios was so outdated it took almost 2 hours to update it. i recently bought a new lumia 920 and it is stunning. battery life is phenomenal (i use it mainly for sending emails, texting, some web browsing). the other day, i didn\\'t have to charge it for almost 2 days!! screen looks amazing, love that i can sync it with my other windows 8 devices. all in all, well worth the money. the phone came with a bad speaker i could return but not replace took it to cell repair place cost me another fifty dollars needed the phone.. battery running out too fast! price is cheap, you have to charge it everyday. excellent buy! it was exactly what i wanted and.my fiancee loves her new iphone. upgrade for my wife from tracfone, took it to verizon corporate store for setup, ready to go in 15 minutes. ported her old # over. screen is too small for me (my iphone 6s is easier for me to see) . bought this refurbished from noble planet after looking at their history. i\\'m very happy with noble planet and with this phone. just like original this was not a new phone! screen protector was reapplied and the charger cord was dirty and wrapped in masking tape. the charger was also ripped open. not ready for prime time due to software bugs and hardware quality control issues. due to quality control issues or a design defect, the screen clicked when touched on the lower left corner when the physical keyboard was closed. when switching from a keyboard open position to a keyboard closed position, rather than a smooth motion, the screen would catch or snag at the top.although there are some welcome modifications made by blackberry to the android os, they\\'re unfortunately rushed to market and buggy. as a result, the phone ran hot and had poor battery life.customers should not be expected to pay a top of the line $700 premium prices for a phone with these sorts of issues. love my phone! it has everything! would buy it again! nice phone, so far !!! bought for my husband, he loves it! as described, works perfect, used phone but couldn\\'t tell because has no scratches, just minor wear on one corner which was easily covered with a case. it\\'s a great phone. screm is very brillant and all apps running quick. this phone will become one of my favorite. excellent phone. quick delivery, everything as advertise. extremely satisfied. samsung s4 is a very very good phone. -still. i don\\'t like this phone i use only one manth and after no mour so please don t bye this phone works great, very good product good, simple starter watch. its features are accurately described and useful. unless you have a sim, however, there are some things you cannot use. still a fun watch and worth the price. works very well, no trouble excellent product, thank you very much ... excellent producti likedand recommend it to those who needexcellenti liked recomementvery very very very good love my hott pink phone excelentt...!! muy bien gracias. i am loving this phone. i don\\'t know if the extra 2gb of ram was really necessary but i tend to load my phone up with tons of apps and the relatively huge storage is serving me nicely. i am using ~ 18gb out of 64 and have barely touched the sd card i added.the ui has been snappy and overall the phone seems very responsive.i have had a few glitches where the home button seemed to go crazy and act like i kept pressing it, but that seems to have cleared up.i am using this phone on verizon and hope to try a prepaid mvno on at&t towers to see who has the best reception in our rural area. on verizon reception seems to be good. i wanted a decent smartphone without paying alot and this seems to be a good phone so far. i have not used the phone camera yet, so i can\\'t say about that. i am disappointed that i cannot open more windows when checking email. it has everything i need otherwise. i am so pleased with my htc evo 4g. i ordered it saturday and received it mondayi had it activated in 10 minutes. i am very pleased and will order from this seller again. it came in perfect condition dosent hold a very good charge but other then that i love it .its really good ...and i love the screen size the speakers fail and it is supposed to be new working good i like the phone added a 64gb card to it. good battery so far. came with 2 cases and ear buds. operating system good just hate that there is no app drawer.speaker is good, wish u could update to marshmallow. but u wanted a big screen and a lot of memory so this was a great buy. love this!!! only problem: i tend to misplace my phone. i went from a hot pink case (easy to spot, even in the dark) to this dark blue, which is nearly impossible to find, especially if you have darker furniture. but the polkadots are too die for! love love love. it also works excellent, my phone got knocked off the kitchen counter by my 90lb rottweiler and stepped on, and not even the case got damaged. definitely impressed and would buy again for myself or as a gift. the phone is great. delivered quick. the 5s is a quality piece of equipment working as i expected it after only owning the phone for less then 6 months it decided not to work anymore (never dropped or touched water) called samsung support and they said the imei/serial number was not on recorded so they were not able to service it under there 1yr warranty service. went to there samsung rep. at best buy and got the same answer even thought they tried to fix it. be aware that if you purchase this phone and if it becomes defective samsung will not service it because it doesn\\'t exists on there database. it\\'s wonderful phone is amazing i\\'ve had it for a while now and no issues. luv this damn phone with every fiber of my being. it\\'s a great phone, so much bigger and lighter than my girlfriend iphone 5. she\\'s jealous now and wants this phone too. its a very nice product... it came as i spected… i recommended… quality 95%... we are using it with no trouble at all 100% ok… great phone, fast delivery. muy satisfecha con el producto recibido, cumplio con todas las caracteristica descritas en la publicacion de la paginagracias, no dudaria en comprarle nuevamente did not realize it had to have a sims card to work awesome product & awesome service. a++++ nice ! when this phone arrived, it either wasn\\'t unlocked or wasn\\'t an att compatible phone which is what we supposedly bought. it won\\'t activate on our line which makes it basically pointless. this phone is garbage. battery life is terrible. i\\'ll be getting something else soon. only good thing about it is the camera excelente proc ducto recomiendo bien .... . . . . . . . . . .. . . . . . most durable phone i have ever had, battery lasts great and it does not lag very much for a cheaper phone. the one problem i have had with a few of these phones is the earpiece going bad. i\\'m wondering if my phone is even new.... starting to regret buying this phone & i just received it today. i cant even silence the camera shutter sound... beautiful phone, works great! great buy i love this watch cell phone e smart.it connect with my cell phone without no problem.love ittttttt.... the power button not working have to plug it in to charge whenever i need to use it so i had to pay to fix that not good that why give it 2 but otherwise is a good phone pros: powerful, fast, very stylish and has an excellent screen display. cons: expensive, can\\'t remove battery and no memory expansion slot. clean and work as a new one!! the best android experience.. pure from google one of the best nexus phones following the late galaxy nexus. no phone can beat these features with that price but the one plus one...if you can buy one :d bigger then expected but dont expect it to do a lot then u expected and they may gliche up so be careful perfect ! perrine worked fine, poor support from blu products for device. no android 4.4 - kit kat like online says. buy this off brand at one risk. you get what you pay for. bearly no accessories for device other then what you get with phone exist. normal fast amazon shipping. i brought this phone one years ago, but it still new and working good plain and simple. everything that i wanted. excellent, fast safe and quality product update. after a year only one of the phones is still working properly. still not a bad phone for the money and served the purpose.purchased 4 of these for the family. have had for almost a year. had to return 1 because it kept shutting off but replacement works ok. can\\'t beat the price for what you get. main complaint is that the camera shutter is very slow. excellent i purchased this for my trip to visit my family in the united states. this phone worked great with a great battery life. it was a tad bit on the slow side sometimes when navigating different applications. but for the price, i was not faltered by it at all. i used a \"straight talk\" sim card and it worked flawlessly with quick 4 g speeds. no complaints. all well excellent product... perfect price, now that ting has a gsm saving lots of money, only problem was that it came with kikat if you want to upgrade to lollipop you will need to borrow an at&t sim and do the update or you could root and apply the update manually with lollipop installed not going to be getting a new phone for some time. great phone thank you! so good i\\'m buying another one i\\'ve had this for about 4 months now. i totally love how sleek it feels. really premium piece of machine. but you need a good case, it feels that fragile. i\\'ve had a samsung phone for over 4 years so using this was no difficult task. nothing too surprising. there are things i don\\'t use much though....such as the edge screen. though the night clock really works well for me. it does seem to be waterproof but i will not willingly test that. but i notice i can still use the interface with droplets on the screen. this was not the case with my previous phone. it is still fairly new so the speed is great. battery life is awesome. i can confidently leave home without the charger for an entire day of heavy use. no overheating. overall, good purchase. i would buy it again but i have no intention of losing or destroying it and i don\\'t plan on splurging on another upgrade for the next 2-3years. i hung onto my s4 for that long. horrible watch would not connect to my android. several tries and the micro sd card wouldn\\'t even fit whatsoever. i was unsure about my purchase on this device seconds after purchase. i have tried many budget android devices in hopes of finding a low cost but high performing tablet or phone. lets say that i haven\\'t been too lucky.over the past 2 weeks i have been researching all of blu\\'s phones and i thought i had found the one! i was looking for 4 things i wanted most from a phone.1. sd card. memory is a big one for me as i have a large music collection and don\\'t want to waste my data on streaming music. what i need is a device that is compatible with 128gb micro sd card and this one is. the amazon description says up to 64gb, i was very happy to see that 128gb worked. i did have one issue and it could have been the app i was using but i had to tell isyncr app to send the music to the internal memory not the sd card to get the files on the sd card. very strange but it worked.2. the display had to be as good as a iphone 4. i can\\'t use any display that isn\\'t ips and low resolution. if i place my phone on my desk and look at it from a extreme angle i want it to look the same as looking directly at it. this phone has a great screen, i would rate it a 9 out of 10. i was very happy with the quality of the ips display. the bright vivid colors and the touch input was dead on every time. the one place that it did disappoint me was in the os, the gradients where not smooth so not sure if this was ice cream sandwich or the display.3. speed!!! budget android devices lag very bad when scrolling through large blog posts or any page with a lot of pictures. the speed of the octa core processor didn\\'t disappoint me. i have a very large music collection and running player pro in album view scrolled and rendered album art very quickly.4. battery life. i really can\\'t talk to much about the battery life as i have only used it for two days. the first day the battery had 50% life out of the box. after charging it to 70% i started loading on the apps and using wifi to transfer my music over to the sd card in the phone. the wifi transfer ran the battery down very fast and had to be plugged in before it ran out.the biggest disappointment and the reason why i sent this phone back to amazon is that i couldn\\'t get the bluetooth to stream audio smoothly. i have bluetooth in my car and the music skipped like a scratched cd. this could be a bug in the ice cream sandwich rom \"the phones os\" and could be fixed when the phone gets the kit kat update.overall i love this phone and would have kept it if the bluetooth worked. if blu updates this phone to kit kat i may try this phone again to see if the problem has been fixed.not sure if it\\'s possible but stock google play rom on this phone would make it shine and remove any quirks i found like no access to quick toggles in the notification pull down menu. a extra gig of ram would have really helped in a few places too. to complicated😢 went back to iphone. work perfectly! i rarely post reviews however, i have to for this phone. i have always been a samsung user ever since my first galaxy s2. i just sold my s5 and was using my s4. the s4 was so dated could not even have two gmail accounts on this phone. so looked for a temporary phone until the note6 arrives in sept/august. this phone is wonderful, the finger print reader is faster than my old s5. the s5 finger print reader was a button that seem to get stuck once in awhile. the a9 is not a physical button but a recessed cut out. i\\'ve had this phone for two days and it has updated just as much as my nexus tablet which is loved(running 6.0 marshmallow). works with att, cheaper than att. att sells this for $520 on a payment plan, this was $349 with prime shipping same day. the model number of this phone is nm82pq9120.the phone reception is not what was expected sometimes i only get one bar (text a lot). i live around philadelphia and never had any issues with att so it may be the phone. other than that i\\'m loving this htc one a9. for the price if you need an unlocked no contract replacement phone you can do no better than this behemoth.... the battery is amazing, last days on a single charge. the phone is good working well %100 y\\'all can see the specs as well i love this phone, better than described. fast shipping, strong packing. great! i do not like the interface/software. way to limited/ing. i tried to replace my samsung galaxy s5. mostly it is possible.pros:big, clear, and very responsive screen, high volume level for media files and ring tones. very good 4g lte, at least for at&t, and wifi, clean android 4.3, without any additions, like launchers etc.battery is huge!cons:power button and volume control are located on the same site and too close.i could not find acceptable hard case for this phone.some extra huawei programs/icons which could not be removed.android lollipop 5 still not available in more then month after announcement.some third party program does not work properly: (helium backup, some others).conclusion:i still use samsung s5 with a smaller screen. i may need a little more time to move to huawei. best phone ever. native android rocks. samsung should think about to use the native android os. so far so good this is really 3 questions to allow me to complete my purschase. does the model titan hd 550a have sensors including compass and accelerometers? is a spare battery available? gorilla glass or, should i get a screen protector?update: aug. 6; received the phone today! 5 stars based on the features. i took a chance based on the $69 amazon price for this phablet. my questions were resolved very positively. 9 sensors! makes this a good candidate for astronomy tools, as i hoped. gorilla glass 3, stated by support. included case and screen protector with my shipment. front and rear flash for the cameras. dual led flash for the rear camera may give a range of white balance for hdr photos. it looks great for the future....oct. 14. 2015 - 2 months into my ownership and i am writing this update on the phone so, there is that.the amazing thing is ... a week ago i pulled up my pants and this phone flew into the toilet. i not so quickly romoved the covers and battery, laid out to dry and, moved my sim to an older phone. the next day my 4 year old grandson came to with the reassembled \\'damp\\' phone. the rear leds are shining like nuts, i panic, fieldstrip it again and toss the parts in a box. i try it this week and, it\\'s ok!i am very happy as this has exceeded almost all my expectations. 1st month i kept pushing the limits until i had 160 apps and, couldn\\'t update any apps. i backed off to about 130 for the past month and it has gone well. i installed the 64gb microsd, added tape to the back of my sim to make it more secure and, packaged the phone in the supplied gel case and screen protector. i try to keep it in my shirt pocket from which it falls from chair height weekly...i do wish i could use the camera(rear) in low light more easily. some different workings but very nice phone tho so far disappointed with the camera bjvjjbkvjvj ok feels like a toy it was basically brand new was def worth the money i spent. pro apple is a great place to buy from. blue life xl a great phone for the price works great the battery hold up for about a day with normal operation if you are playing games you have to charge it but i love it haven\\'t had any problems with it having so much fun with it is nice product... good phone but when you call someone or get a call you can\\'t talk in the phone. the person on the other line can\\'t hear you. too slow and lags in response to the touch. i purchased an iphone 5s from masstechtronics, and i am very unsatisfied. the post said that there were no problems with the phone. when i got the phone, it already had problems. it keeps freezing up, and turning off. every time i try to text someone, it tries to do the typing itself. any time i am on social media, it scrolls through the posts and likes things by itself. to fix it, i have to lock and unlock the screen every few seconds. most of the time, i can\\'t even unlock the screen. i have to restart the phone sometimes. finding this vendor was what makes amazon shopping so great. purchased for a friend who is a faithful and true blackberry fan, and the style flip phone is a classic. it also takes great pix. i purchased this cell phone for my son, he said he liked it and it works good, good phone for the price first, i ordered gold, but got gray. i needed a new phone, so i let that slide. second, the sensitivity on this phone in particular was way off the charts. i googled how to reduce this and nothing worked. still, i put up with that. then, shortly after the return policy expired, the phone started having glitch problems that looked \"matrix-y\" in a way. when this occurred, i had to restart the phone, only for it to happen again shortly after. either this was a dud phone in the batch or it had been refurbished and sold as new, so be leary of buying from seller shalem halleluja. everything is good the connection with the charger is not good. this phone doesnt work with 4g/lte i feel cheated.very low quality headphones, left and right channels are swapped and left is a lot louder than right excellent excelente this phone stoped working after 1 hour...it just turned off and coudn\\'t turn on again. i am highly dissapointed, because this is second phone i ordered on amazon, and with the first one i also had problems...so i will never again order anything from this site!!! although it was the wrong product i ordered i love it. great great ! i had to buy a used product.but it did not contain the earphones.i\\'ve purchased a full component.however, the product is a new product. i bought two supposedly new phones one has loose screws which were already removed. the other one the scroll button has frozen. i\\'m on vacation with two useless phones. you need to do better i did not like it. the watch would not sync to my phone correctly and lost it\\'s bt connection when less than 3 feet from my phone. to be fair, i didn\\'t expect a lot for the price, but, i did expect at least those two things. i am returning this item. fantastic device, great specs, extremely smooth and snappy. the price is fantastic for what it is. the minimal skin they put on over vanilla android is great. no problems caused by the ui or any of their custom features.so why 3 stars?there\\'s no way to enter the bootloader. can\\'t unlock the device. can\\'t replace the recovery. no root, no custom rom. complete lockdown. not cool.i returned mine because of how locked down it is. hopefully they open it up in the future. this *could be* an amazing phone, but at this moment it\\'s crippled by the inability to control it the way i want. seller is helpful and knowledgeable. phone works great! wireless hub were really great , the phone is amazing ordered this for my teenage son and it is a great phone. great fantastic perfect! i love this phone. i recently switched from a major carrier where i had the galaxy s6 edge and this phone tops it 100% in my opinion. i haven\\'t been able to figure out if you can have different ringtones for different contacts yet, but if not this is still a fantastic phone. i\\'m glad i waited for it. after being a happy android user for years i decided to make the switch to this phone. i am very happy with the build quality. the screen is bigger than my nexus 4 with nice color phone was very, very sluggish. apps froze all the time. screen is very grainy. gps (which i use a lot for my job) was all over the place. it seemed to freeze or misread my location often. i\\'m returning this phone. i\\'ve ordered the lenovo 5.5 phone that has much better specs. it costs $36 more, but money well spent to have phone that can at least work most of the time and handle everyday tasks.some pros is that it had a nice heavy weight to it. this might not be a pro for you, however.it also came with a nice case and screen protectorsthe biggest pro was the battery life. of course with a new phone it is always good but this one seemed especially long lasting. probably because of the huge battery size. phone is a christmas present for grand daughter who really wants one but can\\'t get it for herself. i think she will really love it. price was right, packing secure, and delivery fast. excelent this phone, sold by tj global only works in the uk (d855). it does not work in the us and never will. lg makes them locked to a specific geographic area only, and does not unlock them:lg g3 d855 for europelg g3 d850 for at&tlg g3 d851 for t-mobilelg g3 d852 for canada (info found on gsm arena). one can find the correct phone (at least so i hope, just ordered a second one) by typing the correct number, for ex. d851 for the t mobile, together with the name and characteristics of the phone. none of the 16 gb (and there are many) are good for the us though. why the sellers do not bother to add this precious tidbit if information up front is beyond me! none of them has this very, very important detail listed in the characteristics, as they should!!! or list it conspicuously: for europe, at&t, asia...whatever! lg customer help did not help at all when asked (got the advise to buy it from t mobile or amazon...i had bought one that does not work! buy it again??!!). what a bother and what a pain to miss having a phone for so long on account of such a preventable error. this is a good phone but the main issue is the lack of update from htc (stuck on windows 8.0), htc leaves the providers the job to build the updates. but the providers have too many phone to manage, then you can wait until the pigs fly. i freaking love this phone!! it\\'s so big and the gold color is cute, plus it came with a clear case. my straight talk at&t sim card works great in it. it\\'s definitely better than i thought i was gonna be. a must buy my mom is gonna buy a white one next. brought for my teenage daughter..she says she loves it! excelente this was advertised as an international version unlocked. when i received the phone it was full of at&t software, including a block on the tethering function. in addition, the phone reboots by itself every 10-15 min. i have requested a return. the phone is great, but the charger is too bad changed from an iphone to this phone and i am glad i did. i love the larger display. learning the windows system has been tricky but fun. the hardest part for me was finding the right software at the marketplace to use to change the network settings. i pay four one of they phone that was stolen i pay 700$ am returning the phone to get my money back cause it\\'s a stolen phone this person use a stolen credit card so he or she stole some one card and purchase maybe over 200 or more phones to resell to ppl like me who was crazy enough to pay 700$ over da wab to some crazy person i never seen b-4 to top it off i am a federal agent i will find you i will not sleep until i remove you very good phone. reached my expectation exactly came with very small print user manual booklet.searched internet for larger print of it.unnecto air 5.0 user manual...also it was hard to find how to open the phone,to install battery and sims card.over all, android phone is great. as expected i bought this iphone as a christmas gift, so i purchased it early. upon opening it on christmas only the speakerphone was working. you could not hear it up-to-the-ear. apple told us, after we described the problem over the telephone, that it was probably only the speaker module and it would cost about $50. i recently took it to apple to have the module replaced and was told by them that several parts inside the phone was missing and some parts did not even belong to apple. because of the modifications, apple said that it was no longer a iphone and would not even work on it. i understand that because of the length of time the phone cannot be returned, but in the future, please sell items exactly as advertised and not modified. it\\'s a good phone but haven\\'t been able to figure out how to work some features on it such as turning on the flashlight and storing extra contact info. if anyone know how to work these features on the big button seniors phone please let me know what the text doesn\\'t mention is that the phone i received was the world version, not the north american version. this meant that i would couldn\\'t take advantage of lte speed and was stuck with 4g. very happy with my purchase!!! it was a christmas gift for my husband and he adores it. uses it every minute of the day! thanks for a great product and super speedy delivery! after 6 months the phone brokes his procesor...and reboots all the time. and i don\\'t have warranty form the seller! i order this phone samsung prism and what i got was a phone the look like on but is was from china and the branch was huiawei wtf where that is from great product. shipment on time. great price. wow, this is such a great phone, at an unbelievable price. sure enough, it\\'s the end of 2014 and this is the 2013 version of the moto x, but that does not in any way compromise the overall experience.the best things that this phone has to offer are:1) original google design of the operating system interface. this is no comparison to what you would get with a samsung galaxy s phone, which has numerous alterations and additions to google\\'s original, beautiful design.2) fast software updates. when i activated the phone, it downloaded several updates that brought it right to android kitkat (4.4) and android 5.0 (lollipop) is going to be released for this phone any day now. in contrast to updates on the iphone for example, the updates on the moto x bring along *all* of the new software features even for this older phone, and they don\\'t slow it down to a crawl.3) touchless controls. just saying \"ok google now\", or more recently any user-defined phrase, will wake up the phone without you having to press any buttons or the screen. this is perfect especially when driving or if you don\\'t want to take it out of your pocket/handbag to do something quick, like setting a reminder or checking what\\'s next on your calendar. this implementation is also pretty secure, as it trains to your voice -- nobody else can unlock your phone, unless they have a high-quality recording of course.4) no bloatware from carriers.5) despite having a large 4.7\" screen, the body is extremely small. that\\'s because the bezels are kept to a minimum, and the home/back/task buttons are soft-keys on the screen. this is a perfect, clean, minimalist solution, eliminating any physical buttons on the front. this also means that the phone has great long-term viability: none of those buttons can ever break (unless you break the screen of course).6) glance notifications. the phone smartly shows notifications on its lock screen periodically, making the need for unlocking and checking individual apps / app tray unnecessary. like on a lumia, this can even be triggered by waving the hand above the screen, and you then also have the opportunity of unlocking the phone with a swipe on the screen. it follows another long-term benefit: you\\'ll likely use the lock/unlock button a lot less, making unlikely that this button will break even after many years.7) it\\'s extremely fast, responsive, and smooth.the camera is decent, however, if you are into photography i would probably recommend the lumia 830, which should be not much more expensive, or a lumia 1020. but you do get a nifty slow-motion cam, and even hdr on this moto x. great phone i have to return this device. there is no way to use this device on another carriers system i thought this phone was new, but it was refurbished. it has a few bugs still. i had to buy the d821 model in order to make sure it will works in brazil.sometimes the camera focus just stop working, everything is blurred despite the camera app saying it\\'s ok. os is version 4.4.2 (so theoretically the previous camera bug is fixed), restarting the device and tried other camera apps but the problems persists. it can stay in this state for hours. my hope is to be a software problem.previously i\\'ve owned a nexus s and a galaxy nexus and never had any problem with these.otherwise the device is good, screen is big and have nice colors, very fast. battery life is par with my previous galaxy. don\\'t buy it i have this phone for only a month , so far so good. everything is working fine , super fast shipping, right price and just as described. all good awesome phone. even better with purenexus happy with it. 2 hours+ to set up. horrible. wont use sims excelent bueno i\\'m giving this phone a 4star because the battery that cane with the phone is messed up. it dies randomly around 14%-17%. also there\\'s a weird salon colored block that takes up 3/4 of the screen its really hard to notice at first but once you see it its hard to not see it. also apps sometimes crash. only way to fix it is to turn the screen off which is no big deal. but over all i like the phone. the phone works ok. there are couple things i don\\'t like. 1. the sensitivity on touch screen isn\\'t great. sometimes i have to touch several times for it to acknowledge. 2. the internal memories isn\\'t enough. the memory i can free is only about 500mb. it is very slow to response. 3. the position of where you touch on the screen isn\\'t accurate. you think you touch the a, and it could be the q or s instead. the cell is using 4.4.2 android. it doesn\\'t allow files transfer from internal memory to sd card. it runs out of memory very quickly. don\\'t expect it will upgrade the os any time soon. very good i love the feature on this phone ,and the ship time was excellent received phone in 2days, was very excited. opened box, put in a t & t sims card. volume good with calls.........but cannot download any apps from play store, always saying time out. works very slow. thinking about returning phone : ( no fun if can\\'t download music and games. bah humbug !!!!!!! simply put, this phone didn\\'t work for more than two weeks. i really do like this phone, the only real complaint i have is that the speaker on the ear piece and the loud speaker itself are not nearly as loud as my previous phone but overall a very nice phone. she loves it like a newborn baby this phone is simply amazing. the a9 processor is on point, multitasking is a major key, live wallpaper and 3d touch is amazing. i\\'m glad that i bought the phone off amazon and it\\'s backed by their guarantee if you purchase it from their warehouse. i like this phone but i barely have signal. i wish it was 4g instead. takes good pictures but the battery dies to fast even if you dim it to the lowest point. no bad it is impossible for me to review and rate this item as i have not received it as yet. i have been buying from amazon since 2004 and am truly disappointed with this. i really need the phone and it is proving quite inconvenient waiting for so long to receive it. it is one month now and i really need it. getting the money back is not the issue right now, i need the phone. very good phone for the price, almost as good as my laptop. xperia z3+ is the best its ok for the price you are paying. it\\'s too slow and camera take normal pics, it\\'s good to carry because of the size and you can download all your apps normally. sometimes the sound is not good and you have to use the speaker mode. like the phone and it was what i expected. i would recommend this to my friends and to my family. not good deal ,battery life and phone not good love it ! simple operation! excelent smartphone and seller! nokia the best for life! awful...!, the phone is not a genuine nokia, is a cheap copy...! excellent purchase, recommended seller good the phone lost it\\'s imei number after a month. it is pretty much useless for calling or texting. i like but three stars ok😊 i received my phone 3 days ago and although the phone is absolutely amazing and the features come in quite handy on a day to day basis buying this phone refurbished it will not receive a charge so will have to return it in hopes i get one that does. the case is exactly what i expected works perfect for the adapters/charger/plugs from india. so far no complains/issues i got it as a gift for my brother. it showed up and was set to the country code for mexico and was set up in spanish. trying to change it was a 3 day event with hours of customer service calls so i returned it.'"],"application/vnd.google.colaboratory.intrinsic+json":{"type":"string"}},"metadata":{},"execution_count":33}]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["# 토큰 만들기\n","all_reviews_tokens =
